PURPOSE
=======

This is the code behind mwop.net. One part of its purpose is to demonstrate
the capabilities of Zend Framework 2.

In order to run this code, you will need:

 * mongo running on your server or elsewhere
 * ext/mongo for PHP
 * A Google search API key
 * A ReCaptcha API key
 * A registered Disqus site
 * Some way to send mail, and the configuration necessary to do so

To configure the application, copy modules/Local/configs/module.config.php.dist
to modules/Local/configs/module.config.php, and edit it to supply the
configuration values and/or DI substitutions you desire.

To post entries to the blog, you will need to setup an API key. This is simply a
file containing a string; you indicate its location in the Local configuration
file. Once configured, you will need to ensure this key is also available from
any machine that will post to it. To create a post, you will need a
configuration file that defines two values, "apikey" (the value of the API key
on the server to which you are posting) and "url" (the URL to the server and
blog resource). Then, follow the instructions in modules/Blog/bin/post.php, and
invoke that script using:

    ./console Blog:post -c "path/to/config/file" -p "path/to/post/file"

This will take the entry you've created and post it to the server.
