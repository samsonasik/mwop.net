    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/43-Practical-PHP-Programming.html">Practical PHP Programming</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    In the past two days, I've seen two references to <a href="http://www.hudzilla.org/php/">Practical PHP Programming</a>, an
    online book that serves both as an introduction to programming with PHP5 and
    MySQL as well as a good advanced reference with many good tips.
</p>
<p>
    This evening, I was browsing through the Performance chapter (chapter 18),
    and found a number of cool things, both for PHP and MySQL. Many were common
    sense things that I've been doing for awhile, but which I've also seen and
    shaken my head at in code I've seen from others (calculating loop
    invariables at every iteration, not using variables passed to a function,
    not returning a value from a function, not using a return value from a
    function). Others were new and gave me pause for thought (string
    concatenation with the '.' operator is expensive, especially when done more
    than once in an operation; echo can take a comma separated list).
</p>
<p>
    Some PHP myths were also dispelled, some of which I've been wondering about
    for awhile. For instance, the amount of comments and whitespace in PHP are
    not a factor in performance (and PHP caching systems will often strip them
    out anyways); double quotes are not more expensive than single quotes unless
    variable interpolation occurs.
</p>
<p>
    It also has some good advice for SQL optimization, and, more importantly,
    MySQL <em>server</em> optimization. For instance, the author suggests
    running 'OPTIMIZE TABLE table;' on any table that has been
    added/updated/deleted from to any large extent since creation; this will
    defrag the table and give it better performance. Use CHAR() versus
    VARCHAR(); VARCHAR() saves on space, but MySQL has to calculate how much
    space was used each time it queries in order to determine where the next
    field or record starts. However, if you have any variable length fields, you
    may as well use as many as you need -- or split off variable length fields
    (such as a TEXT() field) into a different table in order to speed up
    searching. When performing JOINs, compare on numeric fields instead of
    character fields, and always JOIN on rows that are indexed.
</p>
<p>
    I haven't read the entire book, but glancing through the TOC, there are some
    potential downfalls to its content:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It doesn't cover PhpDoc</li>
    <li>It doesn't appear to cover unit testing</li>
    <li>Limited coverage of templating solutions (though they are mentioned)</li>
    <li>Limited usage of PEAR. The author does mention PEAR a number of times,
    and often indicates that use of certain PEAR modules is preferable to using
    the corresponding low-level PHP calls (e.g., Mail and Mail_MIME, DB), but in
    the examples rarely uses them.</li>
    <li>PHP-HTML-PHP... The examples I browsed all created self-contained
    scripts that did all HTML output. While I can appreciate this to a degree,
    I'd still like to see a book that shows OOP development in PHP <em>and which
    creates re-usable web components</em> in doing so. For instance, instead of
    creating a message board <em>script</em>, create a message board
    <em>class</em> that can be called from anywhere with metadata specifying the
    database and templates to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All told, there's plenty of meat in this book -- I wish it were in dead tree
    format already so I could browse through it at my leisure, instead of in
    front of the computer.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/42-Get-Firefox%21.html">Get Firefox!</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Those who know me know that I love linux and open source. One particular
    program that firmly committed me to open source software is the Mozilla
    project -- a project that took the Netscape browser's codebase and ran with
    it to places I know I never anticipated when I first heard of the project.
</p>
<p>
    What do I like about Mozilla? Well, for starters, and most importantly,
    tabbed browsing changed the way I work. What is tabbed browsing? It's the
    ability to have multiple tabs in a browser window, allowing you to switch
    between web pages without needing to switch windows.
</p>
<p>
    Mozilla came out with a standalone browser a number of months back called,
    first Phoenix, then Firebird, and now Firefox. This standalone browser has a
    conservative number of basic features, which allow for a lean download --
    and yet, these basic features, which include tabbed browsing and disabling
    popups, far surpass Internet Explorer's features. And there are many
    extensions that you can download and integrate into the browser.
</p>
<p>
    One such extension is a tabbed browsing extension that makes tabbed browsing
    even more useful. With it, I can choose to have any links leaving a site go
    to a new tab; or have bookmarks automatically load in a new tab; or group
    tabs and save them as bookmark folders; or drag a tab to a different
    location in the tabs (allowing easy grouping).
</p>
<p>
    Frankly, there's few things I can find that Firefox can't do.
</p>
<p>
    And, on top of that, it's not integrated into the operating system. So, if
    you're on Windows, that means if you use Firefox, you're less likely to end
    up with spyware and adware -- which often is downloaded and installed by
    special IE components just by visiting sites -- ruining your internet
    experience.
</p>
<p>
    So, spread the word: Firefox is a speedy, featureful, SECURE alternative to
    Internet Explorer!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/41-Cgiapp-Roadmap.html">Cgiapp Roadmap</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a few people contact me indicating interest in Cgiapp, and I've
    noticed a number of subscribers to the freshmeat project I've setup. In
    addition, we're using the library extensively at the <a href="http://www.garden.org">National Gardening Association</a> in
    developing our new site (the current site is using a mixture of ASP and
    Tango, with several newer applications using PHP). I've also been monitoring
    the CGI::Application mailing list. As a result of all this activity, I've
    decided I need to develop a roadmap for Cgiapp.
</p>
<p>Currently, planned changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Version 1.x series:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding a Smarty registration for stripslashes (the Smarty
            "function" call will be sslashes).</li>
            <li>param() bugfix: currently, calling param() with no arguments
            simply gives you a list of parameters registered with the method,
            but not their values; this will be fixed.</li>
            <li>error_mode() method. The CGI::Application ML brought up and
            implemented the idea of an error_mode() method to register
            an error_mode with the object (similar to run_modes()). While
            non-essential, it would offer a standard, built-in hook for error
            handling.</li>
            <li>$PATH_INFO traversing. Again, on the CGI::App ML, a request was
            brought up for built-in support for using $PATH_INFO to determine
            the run mode. Basically, you would pass a parameter indicating which
            location in the $PATH_INFO string holds the run mode.</li>
            <li>DocBook tutorials. I feel that too much information is given in
            the class-level documentation, and that usage tutorials need to be
            written. Since I'm documenting with PhpDoc and targetting PEAR,
            moving tutorials into DocBook is a logical step.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Version 2.x series:</b><br>
        Yes, a Cgiapp2 is in the future. There are a few changes that are either
        necessitating (a) PHP5, or (b) API changes. In keeping with PEAR
        guidelines, I'll rename the module Cgiapp2 so as not to break
        applications designed for Cgiapp.<br><br>
        Changes expected include:
        <ul>
            <li>Inherit from PEAR. This will allow for some built in error
            handling, among other things. I suspect that this will tie in with
            the error_mode(), and may also deprecate croak() and carp().</li>
            <li>Changes to tmpl_path() and load_tmpl(). In the perl version, you
            would instantiate a template using load_tmpl(), assign your
            variables to it, and then do your fetch() on it. So, this:
                <pre>
$this->tmpl_assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
                </pre>
            Becomes this:
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl();
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch('template.html');
                </pre>
            OR
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch();
                </pre>
            (Both examples assume use of Smarty.) I want to revert to
            this behaviour for several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Portability with perl. This is one area in which the PHP
                    and perl versions differ greatly; going to the perl way
                    makes porting classes between the two languages
                    simpler.</li>
                    <li>Decoupling. The current set of template methods create
                    an object as a parameter of the application object - which
                    is fine, unless the template object instantiator returns an
                    object of a different kind.</li>
                </ul>
            Cons:
                <ul>
                     <li>Smarty can use the same object to fill multiple
                     templates, and the current methods make use of this. By
                     assigning the template object locally to each method, this
                     could be lost.<br><br>
                     HOWEVER... an easy work-around would be for load_tmpl() to
                     create the object and store it an a parameter; subsequent
                     calls would return the same object reference. The
                     difficulty then would be if load_tmpl() assumed a template
                     name would be passed.  However, even in CGI::App, you
                     decide on a template engine and design for that engine;
                     there is never an assumption that template engines should
                     be swappable.</li>
                     <li>Existing Cgiapp1 applications would need to be
                     rewritten.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Plugin Architecture:</b>
                The CGI::App ML has produced a ::Plugin namespace that utilizes
                a common plugin architecture. The way it is done in perl is
                through some magic of namespaces and export routines... both of
                which are, notably, missing from PHP.<br><br>
                However, I think I may know a workaround for this, if I use
                PHP5: the magic __call() overloader method.<br><br>
                My idea is to have plugin classes register methods that should
                be accessible by a Cgiapp-based class a special key in the
                $_GLOBALS array.  Then, the __call() method would check the
                key for registered methods; if one is found matching a method
                requested, that method is called (using call_user_func()), with
                the Cgiapp-based object reference as the first reference. Voila!
                instant plugins!<br><br>
                Why do this? A library of 'standard' plugins could then be
                created, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A form validation plugin</li>
                    <li>Alternate template engines as plugins (instead of
                    overriding the tmpl_* methods)</li>
                    <li>An authorization plugin</li>
                </ul>
                Since the 'exported' methods would have access to the Cgiapp
                object, they could even register objects or parameters with it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    <div class="entry body"><p>The new weierophinney.net/matthew/ site is now up and running!</p>
<p>
    The site has been many months in planning, and about a month or so in actual
    coding. I have written the site in, instead of flatfiles, PHP, so as to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allow easier updating (it includes its own content management system</li>
    <li>Include a blog for my web development and IT interests</li>
    <li>Allow site searching (everything is an article or download)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I've written it using a strict MVC model, which means that I have libraries
    for accessing and manipulating the database; all displays are template
    driven (meaning I can create them with plain-old HTML); and I can create
    customizable applications out of various controller libraries. I've called
    this concoction <strong>Dragonfly</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    There will be more developments coming -- sitewide search comes to mind, as
    well as RSS feeds for the blog and downloads.
</p>
<p>Stay Tuned!</p></div>

</ul>
<p>
    Okay, so that's actually direct quotes from the article. I took issue with
    it, immediately -- I use <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> for
    everything I do, and the decision to do so was not done lightly. I have in
    fact been advocating the use of template engines in one language or another
    for several years with the various positions in which I've been employed; I
    think they are an essential tool for projects larger than a few pages. Why?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mixing of languages causes inefficiency. When I'm programming, it's
    incredibly inefficient to be writing in up to four different languages: PHP
    or Perl, X/HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Switching between them while in the
    same file is cumbersome and confusing, and trying to find HTML entities
    buried within quoting can be a nightmare, even when done in heredocs.
    Separating the languages into different files seems not only natural, but
    essential.</li>
    <li>Views contain their own logic. In an MVC pattern, the final web page
    View may be dependent on data passed to it via the Controller; however,
    this doesn't mean that I want the full functionality of a language like PHP
    or Perl to do that. I should only be doing simple logic or looping
    constructs -- and a full scripting language is overkill. (I do recognize,
    however, that template engines such as Smarty are written using PHP, so the
    language is being invoked regardless. What I speak of here is the language
    used to <em>compose the template</em>.)</li>
    <li>Abstraction and Security. The fewer internals that are divulged on the
    template page, the better. For security purposes, I may not want clients
    able to know <em>how</em> data got to the page, only what data is available
    to them. In addition, if this data is abstracted enough, any number of
    backends could be connected to the page to produce output.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    So, reading the aforementioned article really got my hackles up. However, it
    got me thinking, as well. One issue raised is that PHP can be used as your
    templating language. While I can understand why this might be desirable --
    everything from load issues to flexibility -- I also feel that this doesn't
    give enough abstraction. 
</p>
<p>
    Using PHP seems to me to be inefficient on two fundamental levels, based on
    my understanding of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Domain Langauge.</b> <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> suggests that
    <em>subsets</em> of a language should be used, or wholly new mini-languages
    developed, that speak to the domain at hand. As an example, you might want
    to use a sharp tool to open a can; an axe would be overkill, but a knife
    might work nicely. Using PHP to describe a template is like using an axe to
    open a can; it'll do the job, but it may also make a mess of it all, simply
    because it's too much sharp edge for the job.</li>
    <li><b>Metadata.</b> Metadata is data about data; to my thinking, templates
    describe the data they are communicating; the compiled template actually
    contains the data. In this regard, again, putting PHP into the script is
    overkill as doing so gives more than just some hints as to what the data
    is.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The author of the article also makes a case for teaching web designers PHP
    -- that the language is sufficiently easy to pick up that they typically
    will be able to learn it as easily, if not more easily, than a template
    language. I agree to a degree... But my experience has shown that web
    designers typically struggle with HTML, let alone PHP. (Note: my experience
    in this regard is not huge, and I'm sure that this is an exaggeration.) I
    find that it's typically easiest for me to give an example template, explain
    what the funny, non-HTML stuff can do, and let them go from there. Using
    this approach, they do not need to learn anything new -- they simply work
    with placeholders.
</p>
<p>
    Still, I think the author raises some fine points. I wish he'd bothered to
    do more research into <em>why</em> people choose template engines and the
    benefits that arise from using them <em>before</em> simply outright slamming
    them. Of course, the article is also a bit dated; it was written over two
    years ago, and much has changed in the world of PHP and many of its template
    engines. I'm curious as to whether they would feel the same way today.
</p>
<p>
    Me? My mind is made up -- the benefits, in my circumstances, far outweigh
    any costs associated. I'll be using template engines, and <a
        href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> in particular, for years to
    come.

    I'd read that you could get binary packages for gentoo, thus alleviating the
    need to compile everything. (Of course, then  you lose some of the benefits
    of compiling everything, but you gain in speed...) Unfortunately, I mistook
    this with ebuilds, and never quite figured it out.
</p>
<p>
    The key is to throw the -g flag:
</p>
<pre>    % emerge -g gnumeric # which is like 'emerge --getbinpkg gnumeric'
</pre>
<p>
    I also learned how to update packages tonight:
</p>
<pre>    % emerge sync             # to sync your mirror with the gentoo mirrors
    % emerge --update portage # if necessary
    % emerge --update system  # updates core system files
    % emerge --update world   # updates all packages

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a bunch of problems with my new computer -- it uses ACPI, but if I
    load the ACPI modules, it won't boot; if I don't load them, I have to go
    through contortions to get the ethernet working, and it won't power down;
    and a bunch of other little stuff.
</p>
<p>
    So, a few weeks ago, I thought, what the heck? Why not try <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>? I've been reading about it
    since it first came out, and I remember talking with Duane about it once,
    and it has a reputation for both being cutting edge and stable. Heck, even
    Wil Wheaton's endorsing it... it can't be <b>all</b> bad, right?
</p>
<p>
    I had a few misstarts -- bad CDs, not quite getting how the chroot thing
    worked, problems with DNS (which I <em>still</em> don't understand; and Rob
    has them as well, so it's not just me). But once I got it installed... well,
    I'm impressed.
</p>
<p>
    The thing about Gentoo is, it <em>compiles</em> everything from source. It's
    like <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, in that it fetches all
    dependencies and installs those... but it's all source. So it's not exactly
    fast. But because everything is compiled, and because you setup C flags
    specific to your machine, what you get is incredibly optimized for your own
    machine. This 1.6GHz machine simply flies. And the memory usage <em>just
        stays low</em>.
</p>
<p>
    I'd like to use it for my server... but I can't really take the server down
    at this point when it's making both my mom and myself money. But what a
    great system... I only wish I'd used it for the mail server at work.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    After working on some OO classes yesterday for an application backend I'm
    developing for work, I decided I needed to create a <tt>BREAD</tt> class to
    make this simpler. You know,
    <b>B</b>rowse-<b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>dit-<b>A</b>dd-<b>D</b>elete.
</p>
<p>
    At first, I figured I'd build off of what I'd done yesterday. But then I got
    to thinking (ah, thinking, my curse). I ran into the <tt>BREAD</tt> concept
    originally when investigating <tt>CGI::Application</tt>; a number of
    individuals had developed <tt>CGI::Apps</tt> that provided this
    functionality. I'd discarded them usually because they provided more
    functionality than I needed or because they introduced more complexity than
    I was willing to tackle right then.
</p>
<p>
    But once my thoughts had gone to <tt>BREAD</tt> and <tt>CGI::App</tt>, I
    started thinking how nice it would be to have <tt>CGI::Application</tt> for
    PHP. And then I thought, why not? What prevents me from porting it? I have
    the source...
</p>
<p>
    So, today I stayed home with Maeve, who, on the tail end of an illness,
    evidently ran herself down when at daycare yesterday, and stayed home
    sleeping most of the day. So, while she was resting, I sat down with a
    printout of the non-POD code of <tt>CGI::App</tt> and hammered out what I
    needed to do. Then, when she fell asleep for a nap, I typed it all out and
    started testing. And, I'm proud to say, it works. For an example, visit <a href="http://dev.weierophinney.net/cgiapp/test.php">my development
        site</a> to see a very simple, templated application in action.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/33-B.-Gates-Open-Source-Programmer.html">B. Gates: Open Source Programmer?</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I just read <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2004/03/19/programmers_at_work/">coverage 
        of a panel of programming luminaries on Salon;</a> the topic of
    discussion was about the state of programming. In the course of the
    discussion, the subject of Open Source came up. Several of the luminaries --
    which included architects of the Mac OS and Windows, as well as others --
    derided the community for basically reinventing the wheel, and wheels that
    need to be re-thought entirely anyways. One questioned, "Why is hte idealism
    just about how the code is shared -- what about idealism about the code
    itself?"
</p>
<p>
    Andy Hertzfeld (who helped develop the original Mac OS)  was sitting on the
    panel, and jumped in. He has been working with Eazel and Chandler in recent
    years, and thus has an inside view of open source. His initial comment:
    "It's because they want people to use the stuff!" Basically, they program
    Windows- or Mac-like interfaces because then people will be willing to try
    it out. They program office suites because people "need" an office suite to
    be productive. Such offerings hook them into the OSS movement.
</p>
<p>
    Another participant, Dan Bricklin (of VisiCalc, a pioneering spreadsheet
    program) shared an anecdote from Bill Gates. Evidently, Gates gave an
    interview (with Lammers -- look up this person) in which he explained that
    his work on MS's BASIC compiler was done by looking at how other programmers
    had accomplished the task. In his own words, "The best way to prepare is to
    write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written.
    In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I
    fished out listings of their operating systems." 
</p>
<p>
    So basically, Gates was an early adopter of OSS methodologies... Interesting
    to see that today he's so protective of MS code. Guess money might do that
    to you.
