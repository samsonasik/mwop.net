    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I recently had an email exchange with <a href="http://blog.bitflux.ch">chregu</a> of <a href="http://www.planet-php.net">Planet PHP</a> regarding Planet PHP's blog selection. I've been subscribing to its
    RSS feed for over a year now, but was uncertain how blogs were selected --
    was it based on popularity of the developer, projects the developer works on
    (for instance, PEAR), etc. I felt that it was time for this information to
    be made public; it helps inform the readership why they're reading what
    they're reading.
</p>
<p>
    And my exchange with him resulted in his <a href="http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/2005/05/26/planet-php-faq.html">Planet PHP FAQ</a> blog entry, which hopefully someday will become a static page
    on the site. Additionally, I found out how new blogs get added, and am proud
    to announce I'm now in the lineup!
</p>
<p>
    (Of course, the timing could not really be worse, come to think of it. I'm
    moving my family in to town this weekend (from our house in the Green
    Mountains of Vermont), and I need to make arrangements for hosting
    weierophinney.net in the interim while we wait for phone and DSL service
    -- which won't be up for at least another week :-( I'm sure I'll figure out
    something... stay tuned!)

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/74-PEAR-and-DocBook-documentation.html">PEAR and DocBook documentation</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Sean Coates has posted a rant and <a
        href="http://blog.phpdoc.info/comment.php?type=trackback&entry_id=14">a
        blog entry</a> regarding DocBook and the various proposals on PEAR
    related to using a wiki for package documentation.
</p>
<p>
    A little background is probably in order. Many PEAR developers feel that
    DocBook is needlessly difficult and provides a barrier to writing good
    documentation for PEAR projects; this is actually the most often-cited
    reason for lack of documentation for a PEAR package. Many actually create
    wikis that they then link to in a minimal DocBook tutorial as "full
    documentation".
</p>
<p>
    One proposed remedy is to create a PEAR wiki for each PEAR package. A
    scheduled process would then transform the wiki markup to DocBook, HTML,
    PDF, whatever.
</p>
<p>
    What Sean rants about is simply this: wiki markup is meant to be simple,
    and much code documentation would require specialized wiki markup.
    Additionally, DocBook is already meant to do the transformations required;
    it is a structured language that is meant to be processed into a variety of
    output formats.
</p>
<p>
    While I agree with Sean's ideas in essence, I still feel that DocBook is a
    real pain to work with. <a href="http://www.phpdoc.org">PhpDocumentor</a>
    offers some real convenience when documenting code: doc blocks can contain
    HTML, some simple inline elements like {@link} -- and they make documenting
    a snap. But I just fail to understand why, when providing tutorials, a
    switch to DocBook is necessary. Whenever I use it, I find that I have to
    retool a set of tutorials I have, or somebody else has, already written in
    order to get formatting correct, and that I have to switch my thinking
    altogether to accomodate a new set of rules and logic.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, DocBook is simply XML with a documented schema. However, I've never
    enjoyed XML. I find it too pedantic, I don't like having to escape out CDATA
    sequences in order to render HTML (and code, and XML, etc.), I don't like
    having to learn new DTDs for every project, and more. I feel for
    configuration, unless you have nested elements, there's no reason to use XML
    whatsoever. And when it comes to documentation, why use anything other than
    HTML? Since HTML is a subset of SGML (as is XML), there's no reason it can't
    be transformed to other formats itself -- and for the majority of PHP
    developers, HTML is a known, while XML/DocBook may or may not be.
</p>
<p>
    Whether or not DocBook is hard can be debated from here to eternity. The
    fact of the matter is that it is <em>perceived</em> as being hard to learn,
    and thus many PEAR developers are simply choosing not to bother. Why not
    give them a tool they can use <em>easily</em>? Maybe then the amount and
    quality of documentation on PEAR will improve.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/73-Cgiapp-1.7.0-released.html">Cgiapp 1.7.0 released</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I'm getting ready to move in another week, and thought it was time to push a
    new release out the door... before life descends into utter chaos.
</p>
<p>
    Cgiapp 1.7.0 adds a plugin architecture (which has been present in the perl
    version since last autumn). Plugins register with the class, and, once
    registered, their methods may be called from your Cgiapp-based class as if
    they were part of it through the magic of overloading. This allows for a
    standard library of utilities to be written -- such as form validation (a
    sample class for this has been provided utilizing <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/HTML_QuickForm">HTML_QuickForm</a>),
    authentication, error logging, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, I created a 'Cgiapp5' class that inherits from and extends
    Cgiapp. Along with it is a 'CgiappErrorException' class that can handle PHP
    errors and rethrow them as exceptions. Combined, the two create some very
    elegant run mode error handling that simply isn't possible in PHP4.
</p>
<p>
    Visit the <a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">Cgiapp website</a> for
    more information on Cgiapp; if you want to try it, <a
        href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cgiapp/Cgiapp-1.7.0.tgz?download">download

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/72-phpTropics-recap.html">php|Tropics recap</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    <a href="http://www.phparch.com/tropics">php|Tropics</a> last week was
    excellent, and I'm not even sure where to begin for a recap. I started
    journaling while there, but found I simply did not have enough time (or
    bandwidth -- my one complaint about the conference) to keep up.
</p>
<p>
    The trip down was hellish. I'd lost my birth certificate, and was turned
    away at the ticket counter due to improper documentation. I was able to
    reschedule for several hours later, and had <em>just</em> enough time to go
    home, look futilely for my birth certificate, and then run down to the town
    clerk office in Bolton to get a certified and notarized letter proving my
    voter registration. Which got me on the plane, but I still ended up having
    to sign a notarized affidavit of citizenship before my final flight from
    Houston could take off.
</p>
<p>
    The resort where the conference was held is called Moon Palace Resort, and
    is one of a string of five or more 'Palace' resorts on the Mexican Riviera
    below Cancun. The place is huge -- there are two lobby areas, and each
    serves what looks like a couple thousand rooms. You can't help but get
    exercise while there, because there's simply so much ground to cover.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://blogs.phparch.com/mt/">Marco Tabini</a> gave the keynote,
    and kept it short and sweet. To my mind, he covered one primary point: the
    PHP job market sucks for pay. As he put it, why does an assembly line worker
    at Ford get paid $35/hour, while the average PHP developer is paid $15/hour?
    This is not to belittle the assembly line worker, but more to ask the
    question of whether or not a PHP developer is inherently less skilled. Marco
    feels that the way to boost PHP wages is to produce a standard educational
    corpus and licensing program -- and educate employers as to why someone who
    has taken them deserves to be paid more. (I'm still not sure how I feel
    about his conclusions, but they're certainly food for thought -- as I'm not
    being paid much more than the PHP average.)
</p>
<p>
    Rob and I skipped out on the first two sessions. To our mind, we weren't
    as interested in them as other sessions, and we weren't going to have much
    free time while there. We put on the swim trunks and took a stroll through
    the pool. Yes, a stroll. I wish I could find a map that shows just how long
    and serpentine the pool there is; you can easily get a good workout just
    going for a stroll in the pool.
</p>
<p>
    And strolling is thirsty business, so we strolled over to a swim-up bar.
    Now, one excellent thing about the location is that the resort is an
    "all-inclusive" resort -- meaning that all food <em>and</em> drink is
    included in the price. So, we ordered margaritas, since it was noon where we
    live. They were okay, a little weak... and Rob noted that the bartender
    wasn't using anything off the top shelf. "What do you think we need to do to
    get him to use the Sauza?" asked Rob, to which I replied, "I think you just
    ask for it." So, next round, "Margaritas con Sauza, por favor."
</p>
<p>
    And so it goes.
</p>
<p>
    Strolling also included the beach, a wonderful expanse of white sand
    overlooking the azure water of the Caribbean. I spent a lot of time just
    sitting under coconut trees staring out over the sea; I can see how tempting
    it would be to retire on the Caribbean.
</p>
<p>
    We started attending sessions that afternoon, and only missed one more over
    the course of the conference. I did get some excellent information from a
    number of sessions -- but one thing in particular I got out of the
    conference as a whole is how far advanced is the setup Rob and I have put
    together at NGA. Our web cluster is almost as good as it gets without
    pouring money into commercial databases and support (though <a
        href="http://ilia.ws/">Ilia Alshanetsky's</a> web acceleration session
    gave me a ton of information on tuning the relations between php, apache,
    and the OS); we've standardized on PEAR and are using it well; we're
    filtering data reasonably well (though we can always do better); etc. I
    often feel like I'm behind the curve when it comes to our technology, so the
    conference was a welcome boost to the ego.
</p>
<p>
    On day 2, I ran into <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog">Paul Jones</a>,
    with whom I've emailed once or twice, and on whose blog I've commented
    several times. We immediately started hanging out, and talking shop. Which
    began the other important aspect of the conference: the social networking.
</p>
<p>
    In day-to-day practice, I really only get to talk code and program with one
    other person, Rob. This is fine, but it leads to a narrow exposure. Going to
    the conference gave me a chance to go over code and coding philosophy with a
    larger variety of people -- my peer group, if you will. I got to see that,
    if you're not working for a large corporation, you do the same shit I do
    every day -- programming, installing and tuning servers, help desk issues,
    everything; coding in PHP is only one aspect of your busy life. It was
    actually refreshing to see that I'm not alone.
</p>
<p>
    A group of six of us got together that second evening, and ate out at one of
    the 'restaurants' (there are several eateries at the resort; not really
    restaurants, 'cause you don't have to pay, and they're all buffets)
    overlooking the Caribbean. As we were talking, we commented on how the
    networking amongst each other was probably the best part of the conference
    -- and how it would be nice if the speakers would deign to join us.
</p>
<p>
    Ask and ye shall receive. Later that evening, as we stood around the 'swing
    bar' (a little tiki bar with swings instead of bar stools, out on an island
    of the large, serpentine pool), we were gradually joined by speakers,
    including Marcus Boerger, <a href="http://netevil.org/">Wez Furlong</a>, <a
        href="http://www.derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a>, and
    <a href="http://blog.backendmedia.com/">Lukas Smith</a>. We had some great
    discussions that started devolving in indirect proportion to the amount we
    drank (well, not really devolving, but certainly migrating to other
    non-coding topics...)
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, Rob and I had to cut out around 11:30, as we were taking the
    <a
        href="http://www.zend.com/store/education/certification/zend-php-certification.php">Zend
    Certification Exam</a> at 8 the following morning. I quit drinking between
    9:30 and 10... Rob had not, so he got to do the exam with a hangover. All in
    all, I found the exam less difficult than the study guide, but certainly
    full of tricks meant to foil you.
</p>
<p>
    The final evening had a similar conclusion to the night before, only with
    even more participants, including <a
        href="http://blog.casey-sweat.us/">Jason Sweat</a> and Ilia. This time
    there were no exams to follow, and we stayed up until 1:30 (and later for
    some people). 
</p>
<p>
    Looking back, I see I wrote very little about the actual conference -- which
    seems odd, as it was the central event. There were certainly some excellent
    presentations, and a lot of great material -- much of it I have not been
    able to find elsewhere. Hopefully I'll find some time to blog about it in
    the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
    I didn't take many pictures, and I need to get a gallery going anyways. Rob,
    however, took a ton of pictures and put them up on his site each day. You
    can view them at <a href="http://riggen.org/gallery/">his gallery</a>; I'll
    put direct links to the individual galleries later.
</p>
<p>
    So, if you get a chance, attend the next PHP conference you can possibly
    afford, and spend as much time as possible getting to know your fellow PHP
    code monkeys; the benefits are, to use an oft-used marketing phrase,
    priceless.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been wanting to play with <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_QuickForm">HTML_QuickForm</a> for
    quite some time, but the documentation has looked rather sparse and scary
    regarding the use of HTML_QuickForm with <a
        href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a>. Since I've been busy at work,
    and I haven't wanted to take the time to learn a new library, I've simply
    been putting it off.
</p>
<p>
    Last night, I browsed through the package documentation, and noticed a link
    to an <a
    href="http://www.thelinuxconsultancy.co.uk/quickform.php">HTML_QuickForm
    Getting Started Guide</a> by Keith Edmunds. I was pleased to discover that
    he also has a <a
    href="http://www.thelinuxconsultancy.co.uk/smarty-guide.php">guide to
    using Smarty with HTML_QuickForm</a>. I got started with these tutorials,
    and found them excellent. I found myself wanting a little more meat
    afterwards, and found that I could now turn to the PEAR docs and actually
    make sense of it all.
</p>
<p>
    While I think Mr. Edmunds tutorials are great for starters, I found that
    there were a few pointers I could have used right off the bat. I present
    them here for you.

<p>
    1.6.2 was tested in a PHP 4.3.4 environment, and features several bugfixes
