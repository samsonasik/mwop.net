      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>My good friend, <xhtml:a href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog/">Keith
Casey</xhtml:a>, is once again chairing <xhtml:a href="http://zendcon.com/">Zendcon's</xhtml:a> <xhtml:a href="http://joind.in/event/zendcon09-uncon">UnCon</xhtml:a>. For those who
have never attended, it's basically one or more tracks running
parallel to the main conference, but with content pitched by
attendees -- sometimes presented by them, other times presented by
others who are knowledgeable in the field.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Why should you care? There are great sessions already selected
for the conference featuring some well-known speakers from the PHP
world; why would you want to either attend or present at the
uncon?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Continue the Discussion</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>Last year, I did a tutorial session with <xhtml:a href="http://mikenaberezny.com">Mike Naberezny</xhtml:a> covering PHP
development best practices. Following the session, several
attendees approached Keith and said they could really use a session
just on <xhtml:a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</xhtml:a>; the
material covered in the tutorial, while good, did not go into
enough depth for them.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Keith then approached me about doing an uncon session, and I in
turn tagged <xhtml:a href="http://www.lornajane.net">Lorna Jane
Mitchell</xhtml:a> about doing the session. We ended up doing it
together, after sitting down for about 10 minutes of planning. We
had the flexibility to both go over what we thought were core
basics everyone should know, as well as to answer very specific
questions. The session was very well attended, and those people who
gave us feedback indicated that it was exactly the amount of detail
they were looking for.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, in summary, the uncon allowed attendees to get more
information on a topic that was covered only briefly in another,
regular session.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Springboard to Speaking</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>Was your talk rejected for the conference? Are you having
trouble getting accepted to any conferences at all?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Conference organizers have a catch-22 they face every time they
put together a schedule. On the one hand, there may be some really
interesting talks submitted by unknown speakers; on the other,
scheduling known speakers helps put money on the table (attendees
want to hear from established experts). As a result, you see a lot
of the same speakers at each and every conference.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, how do <xhtml:em>you</xhtml:em> break in? You speak.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Speaking at area user groups is one way to break into the
system; good sessions often generate buzz that extends beyond your
user group. But an even better way is to speak at an uncon session
at an established conference. Oftentimes you'll have conference
organizers attending these, or friends of conference organizers,
and this can have a huge impact on your chances at speaking.
Additionally, I've seen a ton of buzz generated on twitter and
blogs by uncon sessions -- and this buzz gets noticed.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Don't believe me? Let's revisit that talk Lorna Jane and I gave.
We pitched it as a tutorial session for <xhtml:a href="http://tek.mtacon.com/">php|tek</xhtml:a> this spring... and it was
accepted, largely on the basis of our uncon session. It was the
only talk I pitched for that conference that was accepted. (Believe
it or not, I have to submit talks just like everyone else, and get
a fair share of rejections just like everyone else.)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>At php|tek, I also pitched two uncon tracks, one on using Git
with SVN, and another on how to write domain models for your MVC
layers. This latter session, on models, generated a lot of buzz,
and was later picked up by MTA for a <xhtml:a href="http://codeworks.mtacon.com/">CodeWorks 2009</xhtml:a> webinar, which
was very well received. I also pitched it for ZendCon this year...
and will be presenting it there in two weeks.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>In short, if you want to speak at conferences, start by pitching
ideas to the uncon tracks at conferences you attend. Prepare well
for it, make a good impression, and you may be delivering it as a
regular session at another conference.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Explore new ideas</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>Conference organizers, besides having to choose well-known
speakers, often also need to stick to known topics. Part of the
reason you see topics on the buzz words du jour is because people
want to see sessions on them. But what about things like PHP-GTK?
or using PHP to write CLI tools? or using PHP to connect to a
specific web service? These may all be interesting, but may not
attract crowds. But what if <xhtml:em>you</xhtml:em>, as an attendee, want to
hear about these topics?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>One aspect of the uncon is that you can vote on topics and/or
suggest topics you want to hear about. This gives you a chance to
help shape the direction of the conference to cater to your own
interests. It also allows you to explore some areas of the language
you may not have known about, but, when you see the presentation
abstract, could benefit the work you do.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, use the uncon to explore the language!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Vote now!</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>If you're going to ZendCon, plan on speaking at or attending the
uncon! And help shape it, by heading over to Joind.in and <xhtml:a href="http://joind.in/event/zendcon09-uncon">voting for sessions</xhtml:a>
now! See you there!</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>Today is the kickoff for <xhtml:a href="http://codeworks.mtacon.com/">CodeWorks 2009</xhtml:a>, a remarkable PHP
road show hitting seven cities in 14 days. While I'm not joining
the tour until Atlanta, I'm proud to be joining up at that stop and
presenting a Zend Framework tutorial during the tour.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p style="text-align: center;"><xhtml:img src="/uploads/CW09_Speaker.png" alt="CodeWorks'09" height="200" width="150"/></xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>When Marco first announced his intentions for the tour, frankly,
my first thought was, "He <xhtml:em>has</xhtml:em> finally gone off the deep
end," a sentiment that he was all too willing to consider himself.
However, the more I thought about it, the more intriguing the idea
was: bring some great speakers to a bunch of cities, and keep the
admission costs down so that locals can actually afford to go.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>My own considerations for going were many. I was initially
reluctant -- conferences are a lot of work, and while I travel
fine, it always takes a while for me to recover on return. And the
full two weeks was completely out for me -- I have a family I
actually want to be able to return to, after all, and a job I like.
(Yes, speaking is part of my job, but two weeks in a row, non-stop,
might be a bit much for even the most understanding of employers.)
Fortunately, for US speakers, Marco had an answer to that: the
ability to participate in either the Western or Eastern halves of
the tour, which would make the total time away much less, though
still an insanely daunting idea.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>One facet of the project in particular kept me thinking,
however. The opportunity to speak with PHP developers and ZF
developers across the Eastern Seaboard is an opportunity I won't
get often. And then there's the ability to say, "I did it" -- I
never thought that'd be compelling, but the sheer audacity of the
event just begs for participation.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>If you're anywhere within a few hours of one of the CodeWorks
stops, and you've never attended a conference before, you owe it to
yourself to hop in the car and go. The chance to meet other PHP
developers, get training from some top-notch speakers, and improve
your skills more than make up for any of the cost -- and you may
never get an opportunity like this again (though I sincerely hope
you will!).</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I look forward to meeting and speaking with you in Atlanta,
Miami, D.C., and NYC next week!</xhtml:p>
