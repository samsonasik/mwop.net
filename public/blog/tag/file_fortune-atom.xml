      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>2007 was a busy year, both personally and professionally. I
won't go into the personal too much, because, well, it's personal,
and some of the details are simply inappropriate for blogging
material.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Here's the short version:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>One trip to Belgium and The Netherlands.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Two trips to Israel.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Two trips to Atlanta, GA (not counting the return trip from
Europe, when I was stranded for a day due to storms in the
Northeast).</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Three different user groups attended, with three
presentations.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One major Zend Framework release</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One PEAR release.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One podcast.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One webinar.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One book published.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One conference attended.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>What follows is my month-by-month breakdown:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>January</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>I finished up the last of my three chapters for <xhtml:a href="http://sitepoint.com/books/phpant2/">The PHP Anthology, 2nd
Edition</xhtml:a>, and promptly used my advance to buy the family a
Wii.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I was also introduced to <xhtml:a href="http://jansch.nl/">Ivo
Jansch</xhtml:a> through work, and had him wow me with one of the
<xhtml:a href="http://ibuildings.nl">ibuildings</xhtml:a> products.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>February</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>Mid-month, my boss at <xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</xhtml:a>,
Boaz, got the go-ahead to use the ibuildings WDE platform to build
our new website CMS; part of the plan would include training at the
ibuildings home office in Vlissingen, NL... which meant I had to
get my passport pronto.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Towards the end of the month, I was invited to <xhtml:a href="http://bostonphp.org">BostonPHP</xhtml:a> to present building a simple
<xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</xhtml:a> CRUD
application, along with <xhtml:a href="http://hagunbu.ch/">Chuck
Hagenbuch</xhtml:a> of the <xhtml:a href="http://horde.org/">HORDE project</xhtml:a>.
While there, <xhtml:a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">Nate
Abele</xhtml:a> heckled me, and then joined Chuck and myself for an
impromptu framework panel; a good time was had by all.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>March</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>I flew to Brussels, Belgium, where I met my supervisor, Boaz, so
we could go to Vlissingen. We spent the day in Brussels, walking
around and visiting such sites as the Cathedral of St. Michael, La
Grand Place, and the Mannekin Pis.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Our visit to ibuildings was very productive, and I was very
impressed by the team there; everybody was very knowledgeable and
skilled. I presented a Zend Framework overview, as well as an
abbreviated version of the Best Practices talk I'd given with Mike
Naberezny at the 2006 ZendCon; the latter ignited a ton of
questions and enthusiasm.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>On returning home, I had a ton of work to do on the zend.com
CMS, and this continued in spurts through November. The job was
made much easier by the ibuildings WDE product.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I closed out a ton of MVC issues in the Zend Framework, and we
released the first beta version late in the month.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>April</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>At the beginning of the month, our landlord threw us for a loop
and announced he was going to sell our apartment... meaning that we
either had to step up our plans to purchase a home, or start
looking for a new rental. Ultimately, we ended up looking for a
rental, due to time constraints. The next two months would be
highlighted with the look for a new place as well as countless
showings of our apartment to potential buyers.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Mid-month, we packed up the family and flew down to Atlanta, GA,
to visit my wife's family. While there, we were able to go to the
Atlanta Zoo and see Mei Lan, their baby panda -- way cute!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>May</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>Mid-month, we found a new place in Richmond, VT -- a small
village about 10 minutes from Burlington, near where we originally
lived when we first moved to Vermont.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>During the first RC for Zend Framework, released at the end of
the month, I introduced the ViewRenderer, a feature for
auto-rendering views based on the current controller and action
name -- a feature common to many frameworks. However, it ostensibly
broke a ton of existing applications by being enabled by default --
not one of my more popular decisions. Since the 1.0.0 release, I've
heard little grumbling about it, and it's now often cited as an
ease-of-use feature -- go figure.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>June</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>The first week of June, I flew to Tel Aviv, Israel, to start
training people on the new CMS, as well as to work with our entire
ebiz team to finalize the work plan for completing the CMS. It was,
needless to say, my first time to Israel or the Middle East, and I
was constantly confronted with culture shock. Europe was an easy
transition to make, but Israel was completely foreign to me --
everything from the way people drove, to the architecture, to the
food was different. Unfortunately, I arrived a day late due to a
flight cancellation, and missed the tour of Jerusalem my supervisor
had planned for all of us. However, he took me to the city of Yafa,
an Arabic city where the Israeli's originally tried to settle
before building Tel Aviv to the north. The architecture was
amazing, as were the winding, narrow streets of the old city.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I was also told during this trip that Andi had requested
transferring me full-time to the Zend Framework team. I would spend
the next week or two weighing my options, and ultimately decided to
do so.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>A week after I returned, we moved into our new rental in
Richmond. The kids love the new place, which has a bedroom for each
of them, a yard, and porches on each entrance.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Somehow, I also found time to record my first (and so far only)
<xhtml:a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/2140-PHP-Abstract-Podcast-Episode-2---Backup-or-Die">
PHP Abstract podcast</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>July</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>We released <xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend
Framework</xhtml:a> 1.0.0 at the beginning of the month, marking our
first stable release. While many still view it as incomplete, the
overwhelming feedback has been positive, and we've had over 2
million downloads to date.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I accepted the transfer to the Zend Framework team, but the
condition was made that I would stay part-time on the ebiz team
until the new site was launched. This meant that the next 5 months
were spent splitting my time between the two projects, often
working late and on weekends to get work done.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Towards the end of the month, we took a long weekend camping in
Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. The weather was unseasonably wet, but
we persevered and had a great time. 5 days of offline time was
definitely needed!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I also finally released the first stable version of <xhtml:a href="http://pear.php.net/packages/File_Fortune">File_Fortune</xhtml:a> on
<xhtml:a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</xhtml:a>, over a year since I'd
first proposed it. The package interfaces with mod_fortune files,
allowing both the ability to read and write such files, with full
binary compatability.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>August</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>Not much to report in August, except work, work, and more
work.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>September</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>My ebiz supervisor, Boaz, flew me to Tel Aviv for a second time,
this time to perform a "brain dump" for the rest of the team before
I transitioned fully out of the team, and also to help setup our
new data center and release procedures. This time, Boaz took me to
Jerusalem himself during my last full day in the country. If you've
never been to the city, you should definitely put it on your list
of things to do before you die. With my degree in religion, the
place was full of meaning for me, but it would be putting it
lightly to say that religion is palpable in the air there. We
visited the Wailing Wall, the Via Dolorosa, the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, and listened to the muezzins sing the call to prayer for
the muslims. The tour was simply amazing.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>A few days after I returned, I flew down to New York City for a
special meeting of <xhtml:a href="http://nyphp.org/">NYPHP</xhtml:a>, where
<xhtml:a href="http://blogs.zend.com/author/mark/">Mark de Visser</xhtml:a>
presented on various Zend products and initiatives, and I gave a
Zend Framework overview.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>A week after the NYPHP presentation, I did a <xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/webinars">zend.com webinar</xhtml:a> on the Zend
Framework MVC layer.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>October</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>October was the month of <xhtml:a href="http://www.zendcon.con/">ZendCon</xhtml:a>. I presented a full-day
tutorial on best practices and unit testing with <xhtml:a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian Bergmann</xhtml:a> and <xhtml:a href="http://naberezny.com/">Mike Naberezny</xhtml:a>; despite the length and
subject matter, we were SRO for most of the day.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I also did a main-stage presentation on Zend Framework's MVC
components, directly following <xhtml:a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/">Terry Chay</xhtml:a> -- an intimidating
situation at best. From the feedback I've seen, the presentation
was well-received, and I had somewhere between 120 and 150
attendees -- phenomenal! (Even more amazing was how many people
were familiar with MVC in general!)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>One great thing about the conference was the fact that I got to
network with a number of framework developers, both Zend Framework
and otherwise, including Nate Abele of CakePHP as well as <xhtml:a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M. Jones</xhtml:a> of <xhtml:a href="http://solarphp.com">the Solar framework</xhtml:a>. Many good
conversations were had.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Late in the month, <xhtml:a href="http://sitepoint.com/books/phpant2/">The PHP Anthology, 2nd
Edition</xhtml:a>, my first published book as an author, was finally
released!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>November</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>I spent much of the month working on <xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Layout">Zend_Layout</xhtml:a>,
a much requested component that simplifies and automates Two Step
Views in Zend Framework. I also started work implementing <xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=33071">
Zend_View Enhanced</xhtml:a>, a set of view helpers for making complex
views with Zend_View possible.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I also started playing with <xhtml:a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</xhtml:a> a bit, and came up with a
<xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Service_Twitter">
Zend_Service_Twitter</xhtml:a> proposal for interacting with the Twitter
API via PHP.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>And finally, the Sunday before Thanksgiving, we finally launched
the new <xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend.com</xhtml:a> site, which was
well-received in the blogosphere.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>December</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>A goal I've had for some time has been to form a PHP user group
in the Burlington area. A friend of mine pointed out to me sometime
this fall that there's actually already <xhtml:a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Burlington-VT-PHP">a Google
Group</xhtml:a> formed; he and the original founder started planning a
meeting for early December. I spoke at this inaugural meeting,
presenting Zend Framework's MVC layer yet again; a good time was
had by all, and a lot of enthusiasm for future meetings was
generated.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I finished up Zend_Layout and Zend_View Enhanced with the help
of Ralph Schindler, and got a new proposal up for <xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Form">Zend_Form</xhtml:a>,
just in time for my holidays to begin -- 11 days with family and
with little to no internet connectivity during a trip to Atlanta,
GA for one of only a handful of Christmases I've spent without
snow.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Summary</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>This year was <xhtml:em>incredibly</xhtml:em> busy -- three cross-seas
trips, one cross-continent trip, a move, and several trips along
the Eastern Seaboard; three user group presentations, and eight
presentations over the course of the year; one conference; one
move; one PEAR release; one podcast; one webinar; one book; and
countless hours of programming.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>My goals for the coming year? I'm too tired to even think about
it ;-).</xhtml:p>
