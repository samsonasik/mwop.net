    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Last week, we performed a long needed upgrade to the company
    file/print/intranet server. Basically, we'd been on a Redhat 8 system, and
    there were upgrades we were wanting to perform, and couldn't due to lack of
    libraries. We could have possibly compiled from source in some occasions...
    but that would likely have shuttled us into a similar dependency hell as
    using Redhat in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    So, we decided to re-install the OS, and switch to Gentoo in the process.
    We've found that Gentoo is a great distro for servers -- it allows us to
    tailor the install to the server purpose, and simultaneously provides a
    clean upgrade path via portage. 
</p>
<p>
    Things went primarily without a hitch. We lost a few databases due to a bad
    DB backup (argh! there went the wiki!), but that was the primary extent of
    the damage.
</p>
<p>
    When investigating the sytem post-install, I discovered some connectivity
    issues with Samba. Basically, when connecting via a *nix-based machine, we
    were getting symlinks reported as being local to the connecting machine, not
    the server. This meant that symlinks on the server weren't being followed --
    which caused major issues for those connecting via FTP, Mac, or Linux.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    At work this week, Rob was doing some monitoring of our bandwidth usage. We
    have SNMP on each of our servers now, and he uses MRTG to create bandwidth
    usage graphs that are updated every five minutes or so. He's been monitoring
    since late last year.
</p>
<p>
    Before January, we had two systems going. The first, legacy, system hosted
    the majority of the content from garden.org, and was done using Tango 2000,
    a web application server that ran on top of IIS and Windows NT 4. I say
    'ran', because Tango 2000 was the last version to ship; the company that
    made it stopped supporting it a year later. This meant we could not upgrade
    our server's OS to Windows 2000 or 2003, nor could we switch to a more
    secure web server, etc. It was a time bomb waiting to happen.
</p>
<p>
    The second system is a basic LAMP system -- Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP.
    Rob began migrating applications to it shortly after he started at NGA 3
    years ago, one application at a time. Mostly, new applications were placed
    on it, though in May 2003, he and the other programmer who was there at the
    time started migrating old applications to the techology. Part of the reason
    I was hired was to continue this migration.
</p>
<p>
    The migration was time consuming, and plenty of other projects often got in
    the way. However, starting last July, we made a big push to get it all
    ported over -- before the old WinNT server fails on us. In January, we were
    able to rollout the new garden.org, which runs on this new technology.
</p>
<p>
    A big reason we were able to finish is because of Cgiapp. I originally
    ported it to PHP last year around this time, and knew that while I wanted to
    develop new applications using it, I wasn't so sure I could sell Rob on it.
</p>
<p>
    Amazingly, it didn't take much to convince him. We had already started using
    Smarty for templates just before this, and were also using OOP in new
    development. Cgiapp just helped unify these technologies and to provide a
    nice, standard framework with which to program.
</p>
<p>
    This last can not be emphasized enough. We started developing all
    applications in three places: an API for data access, a Cgiapp-based
    application, and our templates. Either one of us could pick up development
    of an application from the other without having to spend a day or two
    familiarizing ourselves with the idiosyncracies of what the other had
    decided was the programming paradigm of the day. Sure, we still have our own
    programming styles, but the framework makes it easy to debug or extend each
    others programs painlessly.
</p>
<p>
    Now, back to the bandwidth reports: Rob has noticed that our bandwidth usage
    has been growing steadily on the new server since we switched garden.org
    over -- a 45 degree line. At one point this week, our outgoing bandwidth was
    almost 3 T1s -- and we were having no performance issues whatsoever. This
    simply would not have been possible on the old system -- nor without Cgiapp.
    We've managed to produce both a hardware architecture and a programming
    framework that has proved immensely scalable -- which will in turn save the
    organization money.
</p>
<p>
    I love open source! How else can you create such high-performing software
    without paying through the nose for it?

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/42-Get-Firefox%21.html">Get Firefox!</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Those who know me know that I love linux and open source. One particular
    program that firmly committed me to open source software is the Mozilla
    project -- a project that took the Netscape browser's codebase and ran with
    it to places I know I never anticipated when I first heard of the project.
</p>
<p>
    What do I like about Mozilla? Well, for starters, and most importantly,
    tabbed browsing changed the way I work. What is tabbed browsing? It's the
    ability to have multiple tabs in a browser window, allowing you to switch
    between web pages without needing to switch windows.
</p>
<p>
    Mozilla came out with a standalone browser a number of months back called,
    first Phoenix, then Firebird, and now Firefox. This standalone browser has a
    conservative number of basic features, which allow for a lean download --
    and yet, these basic features, which include tabbed browsing and disabling
    popups, far surpass Internet Explorer's features. And there are many
    extensions that you can download and integrate into the browser.
</p>
<p>
    One such extension is a tabbed browsing extension that makes tabbed browsing
    even more useful. With it, I can choose to have any links leaving a site go
    to a new tab; or have bookmarks automatically load in a new tab; or group
    tabs and save them as bookmark folders; or drag a tab to a different
    location in the tabs (allowing easy grouping).
</p>
<p>
    Frankly, there's few things I can find that Firefox can't do.
</p>
<p>
    And, on top of that, it's not integrated into the operating system. So, if
    you're on Windows, that means if you use Firefox, you're less likely to end
    up with spyware and adware -- which often is downloaded and installed by
    special IE components just by visiting sites -- ruining your internet
    experience.
</p>
<p>
    So, spread the word: Firefox is a speedy, featureful, SECURE alternative to
    Internet Explorer!

    Ever wonder what's keeping that device in use so you can't unmount it? It's
    happened to me a few times. The tool to discover this information?
    <kbd>lsof</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, you type something like: <kbd>lsof /mnt/cdrom</kbd> and it gives
    you a <kbd>ps</kbd>-style output detailing the PID and process of the
    processes that are using the cdrom. You can then go and manually stop those
    programs, or kill them yourself.

    I'd read that you could get binary packages for gentoo, thus alleviating the
    need to compile everything. (Of course, then  you lose some of the benefits
    of compiling everything, but you gain in speed...) Unfortunately, I mistook
    this with ebuilds, and never quite figured it out.
</p>
<p>
    The key is to throw the -g flag:
</p>
<pre>    % emerge -g gnumeric # which is like 'emerge --getbinpkg gnumeric'
</pre>
<p>
    I also learned how to update packages tonight:
</p>
<pre>    % emerge sync             # to sync your mirror with the gentoo mirrors
    % emerge --update portage # if necessary
    % emerge --update system  # updates core system files
    % emerge --update world   # updates all packages

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a bunch of problems with my new computer -- it uses ACPI, but if I
    load the ACPI modules, it won't boot; if I don't load them, I have to go
    through contortions to get the ethernet working, and it won't power down;
    and a bunch of other little stuff.
</p>
<p>
    So, a few weeks ago, I thought, what the heck? Why not try <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>? I've been reading about it
    since it first came out, and I remember talking with Duane about it once,
    and it has a reputation for both being cutting edge and stable. Heck, even
    Wil Wheaton's endorsing it... it can't be <b>all</b> bad, right?
</p>
<p>
    I had a few misstarts -- bad CDs, not quite getting how the chroot thing
    worked, problems with DNS (which I <em>still</em> don't understand; and Rob
    has them as well, so it's not just me). But once I got it installed... well,
    I'm impressed.
</p>
<p>
    The thing about Gentoo is, it <em>compiles</em> everything from source. It's
    like <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, in that it fetches all
    dependencies and installs those... but it's all source. So it's not exactly
    fast. But because everything is compiled, and because you setup C flags
    specific to your machine, what you get is incredibly optimized for your own
    machine. This 1.6GHz machine simply flies. And the memory usage <em>just
        stays low</em>.
</p>
<p>
    I'd like to use it for my server... but I can't really take the server down
    at this point when it's making both my mom and myself money. But what a
    great system... I only wish I'd used it for the mail server at work.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I just read <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2004/03/19/programmers_at_work/">coverage 
        of a panel of programming luminaries on Salon;</a> the topic of
    discussion was about the state of programming. In the course of the
    discussion, the subject of Open Source came up. Several of the luminaries --
    which included architects of the Mac OS and Windows, as well as others --
    derided the community for basically reinventing the wheel, and wheels that
    need to be re-thought entirely anyways. One questioned, "Why is hte idealism
    just about how the code is shared -- what about idealism about the code
    itself?"
</p>
<p>
    Andy Hertzfeld (who helped develop the original Mac OS)  was sitting on the
    panel, and jumped in. He has been working with Eazel and Chandler in recent
    years, and thus has an inside view of open source. His initial comment:
    "It's because they want people to use the stuff!" Basically, they program
    Windows- or Mac-like interfaces because then people will be willing to try
    it out. They program office suites because people "need" an office suite to
    be productive. Such offerings hook them into the OSS movement.
</p>
<p>
    Another participant, Dan Bricklin (of VisiCalc, a pioneering spreadsheet
    program) shared an anecdote from Bill Gates. Evidently, Gates gave an
    interview (with Lammers -- look up this person) in which he explained that
    his work on MS's BASIC compiler was done by looking at how other programmers
    had accomplished the task. In his own words, "The best way to prepare is to
    write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written.
    In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I
    fished out listings of their operating systems." 
</p>
<p>
    So basically, Gates was an early adopter of OSS methodologies... Interesting
    to see that today he's so protective of MS code. Guess money might do that
    to you.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Last night, I created my first RAID array from the commandline. It was quite
    simple, I discovered.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create your partitions using fstab. Remember, primary partitions must be
    created <em>before</em> extended partitions.</li>
    <li>Look in <kbd>/proc/partions</kbd> and note the new partition IDs.</li>
    <li>Edit <kbd>/etc/raidtab</kbd> and create a new RAID array. If unsure of
    the syntax, look up the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html">Linux Software
        RAID HOWTO</a> for more details.</li>
    <li>Type <kbd>mkraid /dev/md?</kbd>, where <kbd>?</kbd> is the id of the
    RAID device you just entered in <kbd>/etc/raidtab</kbd>.</li>
    <li>Format the new RAID device with your favorite filesystem, assign it a
    mount point, and start using it!</li>
</ol>
<p>
    I was impressed with how easy it was; the choices that the Anaconda
    installer present for creating a RAID array made it seem like the underlying
    process must be difficult, when in fact it may have been almost the same
    complexity if not easier.

    I've had occasion to need to grab a specific set of files from a large

    our Apache logfiles at work.
</p>
<p>
    Enter <kbd>find</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
    I needed to get all files newer than a specific date, and with the pattern
    'sitename-access_log.timestamp.gz'. I then needed to tar up these files and

        however, and didn't follow many conventions I know; for one thing, it's
        assumed that the pattern you write will match against the entire string,
        and not just a portion of it. What I ended up using was 
        <kbd>-regex '.*access_log.*gz'</kbd>, and that worked.
    </li>
    <li>The <kbd>-printf</kbd> flag tells find to format the printing. This is
        useful when using the output of find in another program. For instance,
        tar likes a list of filenames... so I used <kbd>printf "%p "</kbd>,
        which separated each filename with a space.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I then backticked my full find statement and used it as the final argument
    to a tar command; voila! instant tar file with the files I need!
