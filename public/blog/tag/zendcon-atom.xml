Casey</xhtml:a>, is once again chairing <xhtml:a href="http://zendcon.com/">Zendcon's</xhtml:a> <xhtml:a href="http://joind.in/event/zendcon09-uncon">UnCon</xhtml:a>. For those who
have never attended, it's basically one or more tracks running
parallel to the main conference, but with content pitched by
attendees -- sometimes presented by them, other times presented by
others who are knowledgeable in the field.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Why should you care? There are great sessions already selected
for the conference featuring some well-known speakers from the PHP
world; why would you want to either attend or present at the
uncon?</xhtml:p>

won't go into the personal too much, because, well, it's personal,
and some of the details are simply inappropriate for blogging
material.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Here's the short version:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>One trip to Belgium and The Netherlands.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Two trips to Israel.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Two trips to Atlanta, GA (not counting the return trip from
Europe, when I was stranded for a day due to storms in the
Northeast).</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Three different user groups attended, with three
presentations.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One major Zend Framework release</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One PEAR release.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One podcast.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One webinar.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One book published.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One conference attended.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p><xhtml:a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon '07</xhtml:a> is finally
over, the dust has settled, and I finally find myself with some
time alone... practically the first I've had since Sunday. The week
was fantastic, and I had many good conversations and brainstorming
sessions. Oh, and I ended up giving three different sessions, so
it's time for links to slides and materials:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-BestPractices.odp">Best
Practices of PHP Development</xhtml:a>. <xhtml:a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian</xhtml:a>, <xhtml:a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike</xhtml:a>, and I presented a full-day
tutorial on PHP development best practices, focussing primarily on
testing and testing strategies, but also covering coding standards,
usage of SCM tools, and deployment. There were a ton of questions
from the attendees, and Sebastian even whipped out some extra
slides at the end showing new and little-known features of PHPUnit.
Basically, reading the slides won't really indicate what we
covered, but is more of a general outline. It was an honor and
pleasure to work with Sebastian and Mike on this, and I hope we can
do it again in the future some time.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-MVC.ppt">Zend Framework MVC
Quick Start</xhtml:a>. This was basically the same session I did in my
<xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/webinar">webinar</xhtml:a> a couple weeks
ago, with a few corrections and a small demonstration. Cal put me
on directly following <xhtml:a href="http://terrychay.com/blog">Terry
Chay</xhtml:a>, in the largest of the four session rooms -- the one where
all the keynotes occurred -- talk about intimidating! Amazingly,
the session was really well attended -- others I talked to estimate
between 100 and 150 people showed up. The most amazing part,
though, was that when I asked how many people knew what 'MVC' was,
I don't think there was a single person who didn't raise their hand
-- definitely a sign of how well accepted the pattern now is in
PHP.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-AjaxPresentation.odp">AJAX-Enabling Your
Zend Framework Controllers</xhtml:a>. I did this talk for the <xhtml:a href="http://www.zendcon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Uncon">Unconference</xhtml:a>,
mainly because its a topic I've been interested in and wanted to
present. In it, I detailed how to ajax-enable an application
through some easy tricks with Action and View Helpers and using JS
to decorate your existing application. The reference app I used was
a pastebin, and I've got code for both <xhtml:a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</xhtml:a> and <xhtml:a href="http://prototypejs.org">Prototype</xhtml:a> flavors available:
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/PastebinDojo.tar.gz">Dojo pastebin</xhtml:a></xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/PastebinPrototype.tar.gz">Prototype
pastebin</xhtml:a></xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>The two highlight keynote speakers, for me, were definitely
<xhtml:a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</xhtml:a> and
<xhtml:a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</xhtml:a>. Neither spoke
about PHP, but both spoke about topics that PHP developers should
take to heart. Perhaps I'll elaborate on those in another post.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Another bonus for me was the number of old and new friends alike
I got to see -- I had many good conversations with Paul M. Jones,
Nate Abele, Ivo Jansch, and Ralph Schindler, and opportunities to
finally meet fellow co-author Lig Turmelle, Ben Ramsey, Chris
Shifflet (dude, we've been to four conferences together, and never
yet met!), and many, many others. I was also overwhelmed by the
number of Zend Framework users who sought me out either to ask me
questions or simply thank me and the others on the team for the
project; I'm deeply honored that I can work on a project that
affects so many developers.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>And now for some down time to recuperate...</xhtml:p>
