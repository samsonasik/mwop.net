    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/41-Cgiapp-Roadmap.html">Cgiapp Roadmap</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a few people contact me indicating interest in Cgiapp, and I've
    noticed a number of subscribers to the freshmeat project I've setup. In
    addition, we're using the library extensively at the <a href="http://www.garden.org">National Gardening Association</a> in
    developing our new site (the current site is using a mixture of ASP and
    Tango, with several newer applications using PHP). I've also been monitoring
    the CGI::Application mailing list. As a result of all this activity, I've
    decided I need to develop a roadmap for Cgiapp.
</p>
<p>Currently, planned changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Version 1.x series:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding a Smarty registration for stripslashes (the Smarty
            "function" call will be sslashes).</li>
            <li>param() bugfix: currently, calling param() with no arguments
            simply gives you a list of parameters registered with the method,
            but not their values; this will be fixed.</li>
            <li>error_mode() method. The CGI::Application ML brought up and
            implemented the idea of an error_mode() method to register
            an error_mode with the object (similar to run_modes()). While
            non-essential, it would offer a standard, built-in hook for error
            handling.</li>
            <li>$PATH_INFO traversing. Again, on the CGI::App ML, a request was
            brought up for built-in support for using $PATH_INFO to determine
            the run mode. Basically, you would pass a parameter indicating which
            location in the $PATH_INFO string holds the run mode.</li>
            <li>DocBook tutorials. I feel that too much information is given in
            the class-level documentation, and that usage tutorials need to be
            written. Since I'm documenting with PhpDoc and targetting PEAR,
            moving tutorials into DocBook is a logical step.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Version 2.x series:</b><br>
        Yes, a Cgiapp2 is in the future. There are a few changes that are either
        necessitating (a) PHP5, or (b) API changes. In keeping with PEAR
        guidelines, I'll rename the module Cgiapp2 so as not to break
        applications designed for Cgiapp.<br><br>
        Changes expected include:
        <ul>
            <li>Inherit from PEAR. This will allow for some built in error
            handling, among other things. I suspect that this will tie in with
            the error_mode(), and may also deprecate croak() and carp().</li>
            <li>Changes to tmpl_path() and load_tmpl(). In the perl version, you
            would instantiate a template using load_tmpl(), assign your
            variables to it, and then do your fetch() on it. So, this:
                <pre>
$this->tmpl_assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
                </pre>
            Becomes this:
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl();
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch('template.html');
                </pre>
            OR
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch();
                </pre>
            (Both examples assume use of Smarty.) I want to revert to
            this behaviour for several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Portability with perl. This is one area in which the PHP
                    and perl versions differ greatly; going to the perl way
                    makes porting classes between the two languages
                    simpler.</li>
                    <li>Decoupling. The current set of template methods create
                    an object as a parameter of the application object - which
                    is fine, unless the template object instantiator returns an
                    object of a different kind.</li>
                </ul>
            Cons:
                <ul>
                     <li>Smarty can use the same object to fill multiple
                     templates, and the current methods make use of this. By
                     assigning the template object locally to each method, this
                     could be lost.<br><br>
                     HOWEVER... an easy work-around would be for load_tmpl() to
                     create the object and store it an a parameter; subsequent
                     calls would return the same object reference. The
                     difficulty then would be if load_tmpl() assumed a template
                     name would be passed.  However, even in CGI::App, you
                     decide on a template engine and design for that engine;
                     there is never an assumption that template engines should
                     be swappable.</li>
                     <li>Existing Cgiapp1 applications would need to be
                     rewritten.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Plugin Architecture:</b>
                The CGI::App ML has produced a ::Plugin namespace that utilizes
                a common plugin architecture. The way it is done in perl is
                through some magic of namespaces and export routines... both of
                which are, notably, missing from PHP.<br><br>
                However, I think I may know a workaround for this, if I use
                PHP5: the magic __call() overloader method.<br><br>
                My idea is to have plugin classes register methods that should
                be accessible by a Cgiapp-based class a special key in the
                $_GLOBALS array.  Then, the __call() method would check the
                key for registered methods; if one is found matching a method
                requested, that method is called (using call_user_func()), with
                the Cgiapp-based object reference as the first reference. Voila!
                instant plugins!<br><br>
                Why do this? A library of 'standard' plugins could then be
                created, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A form validation plugin</li>
                    <li>Alternate template engines as plugins (instead of
                    overriding the tmpl_* methods)</li>
                    <li>An authorization plugin</li>
                </ul>
                Since the 'exported' methods would have access to the Cgiapp
                object, they could even register objects or parameters with it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    <div class="entry body"><p>The new weierophinney.net/matthew/ site is now up and running!</p>
<p>
    The site has been many months in planning, and about a month or so in actual
    coding. I have written the site in, instead of flatfiles, PHP, so as to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allow easier updating (it includes its own content management system</li>
    <li>Include a blog for my web development and IT interests</li>
    <li>Allow site searching (everything is an article or download)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I've written it using a strict MVC model, which means that I have libraries
    for accessing and manipulating the database; all displays are template
    driven (meaning I can create them with plain-old HTML); and I can create
    customizable applications out of various controller libraries. I've called
    this concoction <strong>Dragonfly</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    There will be more developments coming -- sitewide search comes to mind, as
    well as RSS feeds for the blog and downloads.
</p>
<p>Stay Tuned!</p></div>

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/2-PHP-and-Template-Engines.html">PHP and Template Engines</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    On <a href="http://www.phppatterns.com">PhpPatterns</a>, I recently read <a
        href="http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/article/articleview/4/1/1/">an
        article on Template Engines in PHP</a>. It got my ire up, as it said (my
    interpretation):
</p>
<ul>
     <li>"template engines are a bad idea"</li>
     <li>"templating using PHP natively can be a good idea"</li>
     <li>"template engines... are not worth the text
         their written in"</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Okay, so that's actually direct quotes from the article. I took issue with
    it, immediately -- I use <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> for
    everything I do, and the decision to do so was not done lightly. I have in
    fact been advocating the use of template engines in one language or another
    for several years with the various positions in which I've been employed; I
    think they are an essential tool for projects larger than a few pages. Why?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mixing of languages causes inefficiency. When I'm programming, it's
    incredibly inefficient to be writing in up to four different languages: PHP
    or Perl, X/HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Switching between them while in the
    same file is cumbersome and confusing, and trying to find HTML entities
    buried within quoting can be a nightmare, even when done in heredocs.
    Separating the languages into different files seems not only natural, but
    essential.</li>
    <li>Views contain their own logic. In an MVC pattern, the final web page
    View may be dependent on data passed to it via the Controller; however,
    this doesn't mean that I want the full functionality of a language like PHP
    or Perl to do that. I should only be doing simple logic or looping
    constructs -- and a full scripting language is overkill. (I do recognize,
    however, that template engines such as Smarty are written using PHP, so the
    language is being invoked regardless. What I speak of here is the language
    used to <em>compose the template</em>.)</li>
    <li>Abstraction and Security. The fewer internals that are divulged on the
    template page, the better. For security purposes, I may not want clients
    able to know <em>how</em> data got to the page, only what data is available
    to them. In addition, if this data is abstracted enough, any number of
    backends could be connected to the page to produce output.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    So, reading the aforementioned article really got my hackles up. However, it
    got me thinking, as well. One issue raised is that PHP can be used as your
    templating language. While I can understand why this might be desirable --
    everything from load issues to flexibility -- I also feel that this doesn't
    give enough abstraction. 
</p>
<p>
    Using PHP seems to me to be inefficient on two fundamental levels, based on
    my understanding of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Domain Langauge.</b> <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> suggests that
    <em>subsets</em> of a language should be used, or wholly new mini-languages
    developed, that speak to the domain at hand. As an example, you might want
    to use a sharp tool to open a can; an axe would be overkill, but a knife
    might work nicely. Using PHP to describe a template is like using an axe to
    open a can; it'll do the job, but it may also make a mess of it all, simply
    because it's too much sharp edge for the job.</li>
    <li><b>Metadata.</b> Metadata is data about data; to my thinking, templates
    describe the data they are communicating; the compiled template actually
    contains the data. In this regard, again, putting PHP into the script is
    overkill as doing so gives more than just some hints as to what the data
    is.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The author of the article also makes a case for teaching web designers PHP
    -- that the language is sufficiently easy to pick up that they typically
    will be able to learn it as easily, if not more easily, than a template
    language. I agree to a degree... But my experience has shown that web
    designers typically struggle with HTML, let alone PHP. (Note: my experience
    in this regard is not huge, and I'm sure that this is an exaggeration.) I
    find that it's typically easiest for me to give an example template, explain
    what the funny, non-HTML stuff can do, and let them go from there. Using
    this approach, they do not need to learn anything new -- they simply work
    with placeholders.
</p>
<p>
    Still, I think the author raises some fine points. I wish he'd bothered to
    do more research into <em>why</em> people choose template engines and the
    benefits that arise from using them <em>before</em> simply outright slamming
    them. Of course, the article is also a bit dated; it was written over two
    years ago, and much has changed in the world of PHP and many of its template
    engines. I'm curious as to whether they would feel the same way today.
</p>
<p>
    Me? My mind is made up -- the benefits, in my circumstances, far outweigh
    any costs associated. I'll be using template engines, and <a
        href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> in particular, for years to
    come.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    After working on some OO classes yesterday for an application backend I'm
    developing for work, I decided I needed to create a <tt>BREAD</tt> class to
    make this simpler. You know,
    <b>B</b>rowse-<b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>dit-<b>A</b>dd-<b>D</b>elete.
</p>
<p>
    At first, I figured I'd build off of what I'd done yesterday. But then I got
    to thinking (ah, thinking, my curse). I ran into the <tt>BREAD</tt> concept
    originally when investigating <tt>CGI::Application</tt>; a number of
    individuals had developed <tt>CGI::Apps</tt> that provided this
    functionality. I'd discarded them usually because they provided more
    functionality than I needed or because they introduced more complexity than
    I was willing to tackle right then.
</p>
<p>
    But once my thoughts had gone to <tt>BREAD</tt> and <tt>CGI::App</tt>, I
    started thinking how nice it would be to have <tt>CGI::Application</tt> for
    PHP. And then I thought, why not? What prevents me from porting it? I have
    the source...
</p>
<p>
    So, today I stayed home with Maeve, who, on the tail end of an illness,
    evidently ran herself down when at daycare yesterday, and stayed home
    sleeping most of the day. So, while she was resting, I sat down with a
    printout of the non-POD code of <tt>CGI::App</tt> and hammered out what I
    needed to do. Then, when she fell asleep for a nap, I typed it all out and
    started testing. And, I'm proud to say, it works. For an example, visit <a href="http://dev.weierophinney.net/cgiapp/test.php">my development
        site</a> to see a very simple, templated application in action.

    I was lamenting at work the other day that now that I've discovered OO and

    easily document my programs. I'm a big fan of perl's POD, and use it fairly
    extensively, even for simple scripts -- it's a way to provide a quick manual
    without needing to worry too much about how to format it.
</p>
<p>
    So, it hit me on the way home Friday night: what prevents me from using POD
    in multiline comments of PHP scripts? I thought I'd give it a try when I got
    home.
</p>
<p>
    First I googled for 'POD for PHP', and found a link to perlmongers where
    somebody recounted seeing that exact thing done, and how nicely it worked.
</p>
<p>
    Then I tried it.. and it indeed worked. So, basically, I've got all the
    tools I love from perl in PHP, one of which is borrowed directly from the
    language!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been researching and coding for a couple months now with the decision
    that I'd rewrite the family website/portal using mod_perl with
    CGI::Application. I still like the idea, but a couple things recently have
    made me rethink it.
</p>
<p>
    For starters, the perl DBI is a bit of a pain to program. At work, I've
    become very accustomed to using PEAR's DB library, and while it's in many
    ways derived from perl's DBI, it's much simpler to use. 
</p>
<p>
    Then there's the whole HTML::Template debacle. There's several ways in which
    to write the templates, but they don't all work in all situations, and, it
    seems they're a bit limited. We've started using PHP's Smarty at work, and
    it's much more intuitive, a wee bit more consistent, and almost infinitely
    more extendable. I could go the Template::Toolkit route for perl, but that's
    almost like learning another whole language.
</p>
<p>
    Then, there's the way objects work in perl versus PHP. I've discovered
    that PHP objects are very easy and very extendable. I wouldn't have found
    them half as easy, however, if I hadn't already been doing object oriented
    programming in perl. One major difference, however, is how easy it is to
    create new attributes on the fly, and the syntax is much easier and cleaner.
</p>
<p>
    Add to that the fact that if you want to dynamically require modules in
    perl, you have to go through some significant, often unsurmountable, hoops.
    So you can't easily have dynamic objects of dynamically defined classes. In
    PHP, though, you can require_once or include_once at any time without even
    thinking.
</p>
<p>
    The final straw, however, was when I did my first OO application in PHP this
    past week. I hammered it out in a matter of an hour or so. Then I rewrote it
    to incorporate Smarty in around an hour. And it all worked easily. Then I
    wrote a form-handling libary in just over two hours that worked immediately
    -- and made it possible for me to write a several screen application in a
    matter of an hour, complete with form, form validation, and database calls.
    Doing the same with CGI::Application took me hours, if not days.
</p>
<p>
    So, my idea is this: port CGI::Application to PHP. I <em>love</em> the
    concept of CGI::App -- it's exactly how I want to program, and I think it's
    solid. However, by porting it to PHP, I automatically have session and
    cookie support, and database support is only a few lines of code away when I
    use PEAR; I'll add Smarty as the template toolkit of choice, but make it
    easy to override the template methods to utilize . I get a nice MVC-style
    application template, but one that makes developing quickie applications
    truly a snap.
</p>
<p>
    This falls under the "right-tool-for-the-job" category; perl, while a
    wonderful language, and with a large tradition as a CGI language, was not
    developed <em>for the web</em> as PHP was. PHP just makes more sense in this
    instance. And I won't be abandoning perl by any stretch; I still use it
    daily at work and at home for solving any number of tasks from automated
    backups to checking server availability to keeping my ethernet connection
    alive. But I have real strengths as a PHP developer, and it would be a shame
    not to use those strengths with our home website.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    We're starting to use OO in our PHP at work. I discovered when I started
    using it why I'd been having problems wrapping my head around some of the
    applications I've been programming lately: I've become accustomed in Perl to
    using an OO framework. Suddenly, programming in PHP was much easier.
</p>
<p>
    There's a few things that are different, however. It appears that you cannot
    pass objects in object attributes, and then reference them like thus:
</p>
<pre>    $object->db>query($sql)
</pre>
<p>
    PHP doesn't like that kind of syntax (at least not in versions 4.x).
    Instead, you have to pass a reference to the object in the attribute, then
    set a temporary variable to that reference whenever you wish to use it:
</p>
<pre>    $object->db =& $db;
    ...
    $db = $object->db;
    $res = $db->query($sql);
</pre>
<p>
    What if you want to inherit from another class and extend one of the
    methods? In other words, you want to use the method from the parent class,
    but you want to do some additional items with it? Simple: use
    <kbd>parent</kbd>:
</p>
<pre>    function method1()
    {
        /* do some pre-processing */

        parent::method1(); // Do the parent's version of the method

        /* do some more stuff here */
    }
</pre>
<h4>Update:</h4>
<p>
    Actually, you *can* reference objects when they are attributes of another
    object; you just have to define the references in the correct order:
</p>
<pre>    $db =& DB::connect('dsn');
    $this->db =& $db;
    ...
    $res = $this->db->query($sql);
</pre>
<p>
    I've tested the above syntax with both PEAR's DB and with Smarty, and it
    works without issue.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I was just reading an <a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7372&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0">article
        about the Dean campaign's IT infrastructure</a>, and there's an
    interesting quote from their IT manager, Harish Rao:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "I believe in three principles", he said. "First I always make sure I hire
    people I can trust 100%. Second, I always try to hire people who are smarter
    than I am. Third, I give them the independence to do as they see fit as long
    as they communicate about it to their other team members. We've had a lot of
    growing pains, a lot of issues; but we've been able to deal with them
    because we have a high level of trust, skill and communication."
</blockquote>
<p>
    I know for myself that when I (1) don't feel trusted, and/or (2) am not
    given independence to do what I see as necessary to do my job, I don't
    communicate with my superiors about my actions, and I also get lazy about my
    job because I don't feel my work is valued.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, I feel that in my current work situation, my employers followed
    the same principles as Rao, and I've felt more productive and appreciated
    than I've felt in any previous job.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been thinking about trying to standardize the PHP code we do at work.
    Rob and I follow similar styles, but there are some definite differences. It
    would make delving into eachother's code much easier if we both followed
    some basic, agreed upon, guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I've been thinking about is function declarations. I find that I'm
    often retooling a function to make it more general, and in doing so either
    need to decrease or increase the number of arguments to it. This, of course,
    breaks compatability.
</p>
<p>
    So I propose that we have all functions take two arguments: $data and $db.
    $data is a hash which can then be extract'd via PHP. To change the number of
    arguments, you can simply set defaults for arguments or return meaningful
    errors for missing arguments.
</p>
<p>
    Another thought going through my mind deals with the fact that we reuse many
    of our applications across our various sites, and also export some of them.
    I think we should try and code the applications as functional libraries or
    classes, and then place them somewhere in PHP's include path. We can then
    have a "demo" area that shows how to use the libraries/classes (i.e.,
    example scripts), and to utilize a given application, we need simply include
    it like: 'include 'apps/eventCalendar/calendar.inc';'. This gives us maximum
    portability, and also forces us to code concisely and document vigorously.
</p>
<p>
    I was also reading on php.general tonight, and noticed some questions about
    PHP standards. Several people contend that PEAR is becoming the de facto
    standard, as it's the de facto extension library. In addition, because it is
    becoming a standard, there's also a standard for documenting projects, and
    this is phpdocumenter. The relevant links are:

        Standards</a></li>
