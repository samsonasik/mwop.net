      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>Last year, a new conference launched, <xhtml:a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/">Brooklyn Beta</xhtml:a>. The buzz I heard
about it from attendees was amazing; words like "inspiring,"
"intimate," and "energizing" were all used to describe the
experience. I found myself wishing I'd made time in my schedule to
attend.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Fast forward a few months, and a new conference has been
announced, <xhtml:a href="http://phpcon.org/">the PHP Community
Conference</xhtml:a>. It has similar goals to Brooklyn Beta: create a
conference where we can talk about the language we love so
passionately.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p><xhtml:a href="http://phpcon.org/speakers">The lineup of speakers</xhtml:a>
is simply amazing. These are people doing amazing things with PHP,
and passionate about PHP and what they're building with it. Some
have been working on projects forever (Brian Moon's been working on
Phorum almost as long as PHP has been around), others are building
the next generation of tools and sites we'll be using (Paul
Reinheimer's XHProf and WonderProxy, FictiveKin's Gimme Bar).</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I was fortunate enough to be invited to speak as well, to speak
about Zend Framework 2, and provide some training in some of the
exciting new tools and components you'll be seeing from the project
this year.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'm particularly excited to finally meet <xhtml:a href="http://toys.lerdorf.com/">Rasmus</xhtml:a> -- we've not yet managed to
cross paths in the 5 years and greater than a dozen conferences
I've attended or spoken at. But most exciting is knowing that, due
to the small size and venue of the conference, attendees will be
peers with all of us speaking, allowing us to have good dialog
about what it is we <xhtml:em>do</xhtml:em> and want to <xhtml:em>create</xhtml:em>.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>If you haven't <xhtml:a href="http://phpcon.eventbrite.com/">bought
your ticket yet</xhtml:a> -- and hey, they're only $300! a steal at twice
the price! -- what are you waiting for?</xhtml:p>
