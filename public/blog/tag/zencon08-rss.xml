    I'm a bit late on my <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon'08</a>
    wrapup; the conference left me both exhausted and with a backlog of email
    and work that has consumed me since it ended. However, this, too, is good,
    as it has given me time to reflect... and to finally get my slides up on
    SlideShare.

    ZendCon was alternately exhausting, rewarding, educational, fruitful,
    infurating, and ultimately wonderful. I've been to every single ZendCon so
    far -- I started at Zend a scant month before the inaugural event -- and
    have spoken at each. My first time speaking was a fluke; 
    <a href="http://www.sklar.com/">David Sklar</a> had just started at 
    <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> and had to back out of his
    "Configuring PHP" tutorial session. 
    <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike Naberezny</a> and I were drafted to
    take it over, and we had N+1 attendees, where N was the number of speakers.
    Since that inauspicious beginning, I've gradually taken on more sessions and
    stuck around to participate in the conference more. I can honestly say that
    this was the biggest, busiest, and most community focussed ZendCon I can
    remember.
