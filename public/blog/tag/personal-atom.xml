      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I'm really not sure I understand these "seven things" or
"tagged" memes, but I'm going to give it a shot, after <xhtml:a href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog/seven-things-tagged-by-tony-bibbs">Keith
Casey</xhtml:a> did a drive-by tagging of me on New Year's Eve.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, without further ado, seven things you may not know about
me...</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:em>My actual college degree is in comparative religion.</xhtml:em> I
ended up in the Religion department at the <xhtml:a href="http://www.ups.edu/">University of Puget Sound</xhtml:a> (yes, the
initials are UPS, which can easily cause confusion with brown,
parcel-bearing trucks), due to a line of questioning that occurred
during an Artificial Intelligence course I was taking. The
instructor was asking if there would be any ethical barrier to
unplugging an AI -- i.e., since it would be capable of thought,
would this be equivalent to "killing" it? My initial response was,
"No," because humans consist of more than thought... and then I
started wondering a bit about that. My emphasis in religion was in
Eastern religions. I have a minor in Mathematics (CS at UPS was
actually CS/Mathematics).</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:em>I have an FCC Commercial Radio Operator's License.</xhtml:em> My
parents were volunteer DJs at <xhtml:a href="http://www.kglt.net/">KGLT</xhtml:a> while I was growing up, and I did
my first radio announcing at... get this... the ripe age of 11. I
finally got my license before starting college so that I could be a
DJ at the university station... and ended up as the General Manager
of <xhtml:a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUPS">KUPS</xhtml:a> my last two
years.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:em>I had long hair -- down to my butt at times -- for around
ten years.</xhtml:em> Which likely comes as a huge shock to those of you
who have met me at conferences. Ironically, I cut it off just prior
to moving to Vermont as part of an effort to increase the success
of my job hunt.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:em>Before I started my programming career, I was a graphics
technician.</xhtml:em> The job immediately prior to my first programming
position was with a small book publisher that specialized in bird
hunting and flyfishing guidebooks, for which I created maps,
scanned and processed images for books, and did book and catalog
layout.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:em>My first Object Oriented Programming was in Perl.</xhtml:em> If
you've ever done OOP in Perl, you'll likely agree with the
following statement: OOP in any other language is easy by
comparison. I mean, come on, a syntax where the very definition of
an object requires that you "bless" a "thingy"? Truly; this is from
the "bless" documentation:
<xhtml:blockquote>bless REF: This function tells the thingy referenced by
REF that it is now an object in the CLASSNAME package. If CLASSNAME
is omitted, the current package is used. Because a bless is often
the last thing in a constructor, it returns the reference for
convenience. Always use the two-argument version if a derived class
might inherit the function doing the blessing. See perltoot and
perlobj for more about the blessing (and blessings) of
objects.</xhtml:blockquote>
This made OOP in PHP look easy.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:em>I hold the degree of shodan in Aikido,</xhtml:em> though I
haven't trained in several years, due to time and travel
constraints. I love the movement and flow of Aikido, and always
found it very meditative. I also liked working with weapons,
especially the bokken (wooden sword). This is why when I say,
"don't make me get my clue bat out," you should take heed; I know
from experience that white oak leaves a mark.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:em>I could have been <xhtml:a href="http://calevans.com/">Cal</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:em> When <xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</xhtml:a> first interviewed me, it was for
the position of Editor-in-Chief of <xhtml:a href="http://devzone.zend.com/">DevZone</xhtml:a>. After my in-house
interview, I had reservations -- I didn't feel experienced or
connected enough, and was worried I'd botch it. Fortunately for me,
and probably the PHP community in general, they decided to hire me
as a PHP developer instead.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>So, that's seven things (and quite a bit more, really) about me.
And now it's time to tag some others:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://calevans.com/">Cal Evans</xhtml:a> is an obvious
choice for me. Besides having worked together for some years, he's
a great friend.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://www.leftontheweb.com/">Stefan Koopmanschap</xhtml:a>,
who took a train to Amsterdam just to have dinner and a beer with
me.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://seancoates.com/">Sean Coates</xhtml:a>, whom I met in
an airport on the way back from ZendCon two years ago, who lives
less than two hours away, and whom I haven't seen since that
ZendCon.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://www.lornajane.net/">Lorna Jane Mitchell</xhtml:a>,
with whom I'll be doing a tutorial session on Subversion at
php|tek, and who will be clearly flustered by being tagged.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://jansch.nl/">Ivo Jansch</xhtml:a>, whom I met almost
two years ago, and somebody I admire and respect greatly.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://www.khankennnels.com/blog/">Ligaya
Turmelle</xhtml:a>, one of my co-authors for "The PHP Anthology," the
woman who got me to volunteer as a phpwomen Booth Babe, and now
MySQL guru.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://akrabat.com/">Rob Allen</xhtml:a>, who has made my
job easier by publishing tutorials and now a book on Zend
Framework, and who in real-life is a mild-mannered Clark Kent I'd
gladly raise a pint with any day.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>And here are the rules I'm supposed to pass on to the above
bloggers:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>Link your original tagger(s), and list these rules on your
blog.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Share seven facts about yourself in the post - some random,
some wierd.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names
and the links to their blogs.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Let them know they've been tagged by leaving a comment on their
blogs and/or Twitter.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>2007 was a busy year, both personally and professionally. I
won't go into the personal too much, because, well, it's personal,
and some of the details are simply inappropriate for blogging
material.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Here's the short version:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>One trip to Belgium and The Netherlands.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Two trips to Israel.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Two trips to Atlanta, GA (not counting the return trip from
Europe, when I was stranded for a day due to storms in the
Northeast).</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Three different user groups attended, with three
presentations.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One major Zend Framework release</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One PEAR release.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One podcast.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One webinar.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One book published.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>One conference attended.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>What follows is my month-by-month breakdown:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>January</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>I finished up the last of my three chapters for <xhtml:a href="http://sitepoint.com/books/phpant2/">The PHP Anthology, 2nd
Edition</xhtml:a>, and promptly used my advance to buy the family a
Wii.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I was also introduced to <xhtml:a href="http://jansch.nl/">Ivo
Jansch</xhtml:a> through work, and had him wow me with one of the
<xhtml:a href="http://ibuildings.nl">ibuildings</xhtml:a> products.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>February</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>Mid-month, my boss at <xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</xhtml:a>,
Boaz, got the go-ahead to use the ibuildings WDE platform to build
our new website CMS; part of the plan would include training at the
ibuildings home office in Vlissingen, NL... which meant I had to
get my passport pronto.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Towards the end of the month, I was invited to <xhtml:a href="http://bostonphp.org">BostonPHP</xhtml:a> to present building a simple
<xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</xhtml:a> CRUD
application, along with <xhtml:a href="http://hagunbu.ch/">Chuck
Hagenbuch</xhtml:a> of the <xhtml:a href="http://horde.org/">HORDE project</xhtml:a>.
While there, <xhtml:a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">Nate
Abele</xhtml:a> heckled me, and then joined Chuck and myself for an
impromptu framework panel; a good time was had by all.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>March</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>I flew to Brussels, Belgium, where I met my supervisor, Boaz, so
we could go to Vlissingen. We spent the day in Brussels, walking
around and visiting such sites as the Cathedral of St. Michael, La
Grand Place, and the Mannekin Pis.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Our visit to ibuildings was very productive, and I was very
impressed by the team there; everybody was very knowledgeable and
skilled. I presented a Zend Framework overview, as well as an
abbreviated version of the Best Practices talk I'd given with Mike
Naberezny at the 2006 ZendCon; the latter ignited a ton of
questions and enthusiasm.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>On returning home, I had a ton of work to do on the zend.com
CMS, and this continued in spurts through November. The job was
made much easier by the ibuildings WDE product.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I closed out a ton of MVC issues in the Zend Framework, and we
released the first beta version late in the month.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>April</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>At the beginning of the month, our landlord threw us for a loop
and announced he was going to sell our apartment... meaning that we
either had to step up our plans to purchase a home, or start
looking for a new rental. Ultimately, we ended up looking for a
rental, due to time constraints. The next two months would be
highlighted with the look for a new place as well as countless
showings of our apartment to potential buyers.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Mid-month, we packed up the family and flew down to Atlanta, GA,
to visit my wife's family. While there, we were able to go to the
Atlanta Zoo and see Mei Lan, their baby panda -- way cute!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>May</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>Mid-month, we found a new place in Richmond, VT -- a small
village about 10 minutes from Burlington, near where we originally
lived when we first moved to Vermont.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>During the first RC for Zend Framework, released at the end of
the month, I introduced the ViewRenderer, a feature for
auto-rendering views based on the current controller and action
name -- a feature common to many frameworks. However, it ostensibly
broke a ton of existing applications by being enabled by default --
not one of my more popular decisions. Since the 1.0.0 release, I've
heard little grumbling about it, and it's now often cited as an
ease-of-use feature -- go figure.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>June</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>The first week of June, I flew to Tel Aviv, Israel, to start
training people on the new CMS, as well as to work with our entire
ebiz team to finalize the work plan for completing the CMS. It was,
needless to say, my first time to Israel or the Middle East, and I
was constantly confronted with culture shock. Europe was an easy
transition to make, but Israel was completely foreign to me --
everything from the way people drove, to the architecture, to the
food was different. Unfortunately, I arrived a day late due to a
flight cancellation, and missed the tour of Jerusalem my supervisor
had planned for all of us. However, he took me to the city of Yafa,
an Arabic city where the Israeli's originally tried to settle
before building Tel Aviv to the north. The architecture was
amazing, as were the winding, narrow streets of the old city.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I was also told during this trip that Andi had requested
transferring me full-time to the Zend Framework team. I would spend
the next week or two weighing my options, and ultimately decided to
do so.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>A week after I returned, we moved into our new rental in
Richmond. The kids love the new place, which has a bedroom for each
of them, a yard, and porches on each entrance.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Somehow, I also found time to record my first (and so far only)
<xhtml:a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/2140-PHP-Abstract-Podcast-Episode-2---Backup-or-Die">
PHP Abstract podcast</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>July</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>We released <xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend
Framework</xhtml:a> 1.0.0 at the beginning of the month, marking our
first stable release. While many still view it as incomplete, the
overwhelming feedback has been positive, and we've had over 2
million downloads to date.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I accepted the transfer to the Zend Framework team, but the
condition was made that I would stay part-time on the ebiz team
until the new site was launched. This meant that the next 5 months
were spent splitting my time between the two projects, often
working late and on weekends to get work done.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Towards the end of the month, we took a long weekend camping in
Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. The weather was unseasonably wet, but
we persevered and had a great time. 5 days of offline time was
definitely needed!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I also finally released the first stable version of <xhtml:a href="http://pear.php.net/packages/File_Fortune">File_Fortune</xhtml:a> on
<xhtml:a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</xhtml:a>, over a year since I'd
first proposed it. The package interfaces with mod_fortune files,
allowing both the ability to read and write such files, with full
binary compatability.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>August</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>Not much to report in August, except work, work, and more
work.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>September</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>My ebiz supervisor, Boaz, flew me to Tel Aviv for a second time,
this time to perform a "brain dump" for the rest of the team before
I transitioned fully out of the team, and also to help setup our
new data center and release procedures. This time, Boaz took me to
Jerusalem himself during my last full day in the country. If you've
never been to the city, you should definitely put it on your list
of things to do before you die. With my degree in religion, the
place was full of meaning for me, but it would be putting it
lightly to say that religion is palpable in the air there. We
visited the Wailing Wall, the Via Dolorosa, the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, and listened to the muezzins sing the call to prayer for
the muslims. The tour was simply amazing.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>A few days after I returned, I flew down to New York City for a
special meeting of <xhtml:a href="http://nyphp.org/">NYPHP</xhtml:a>, where
<xhtml:a href="http://blogs.zend.com/author/mark/">Mark de Visser</xhtml:a>
presented on various Zend products and initiatives, and I gave a
Zend Framework overview.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>A week after the NYPHP presentation, I did a <xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/webinars">zend.com webinar</xhtml:a> on the Zend
Framework MVC layer.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>October</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>October was the month of <xhtml:a href="http://www.zendcon.con/">ZendCon</xhtml:a>. I presented a full-day
tutorial on best practices and unit testing with <xhtml:a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian Bergmann</xhtml:a> and <xhtml:a href="http://naberezny.com/">Mike Naberezny</xhtml:a>; despite the length and
subject matter, we were SRO for most of the day.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I also did a main-stage presentation on Zend Framework's MVC
components, directly following <xhtml:a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/">Terry Chay</xhtml:a> -- an intimidating
situation at best. From the feedback I've seen, the presentation
was well-received, and I had somewhere between 120 and 150
attendees -- phenomenal! (Even more amazing was how many people
were familiar with MVC in general!)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>One great thing about the conference was the fact that I got to
network with a number of framework developers, both Zend Framework
and otherwise, including Nate Abele of CakePHP as well as <xhtml:a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M. Jones</xhtml:a> of <xhtml:a href="http://solarphp.com">the Solar framework</xhtml:a>. Many good
conversations were had.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Late in the month, <xhtml:a href="http://sitepoint.com/books/phpant2/">The PHP Anthology, 2nd
Edition</xhtml:a>, my first published book as an author, was finally
released!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>November</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>I spent much of the month working on <xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Layout">Zend_Layout</xhtml:a>,
a much requested component that simplifies and automates Two Step
Views in Zend Framework. I also started work implementing <xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=33071">
Zend_View Enhanced</xhtml:a>, a set of view helpers for making complex
views with Zend_View possible.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I also started playing with <xhtml:a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</xhtml:a> a bit, and came up with a
<xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Service_Twitter">
Zend_Service_Twitter</xhtml:a> proposal for interacting with the Twitter
API via PHP.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>And finally, the Sunday before Thanksgiving, we finally launched
the new <xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend.com</xhtml:a> site, which was
well-received in the blogosphere.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>December</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>A goal I've had for some time has been to form a PHP user group
in the Burlington area. A friend of mine pointed out to me sometime
this fall that there's actually already <xhtml:a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Burlington-VT-PHP">a Google
Group</xhtml:a> formed; he and the original founder started planning a
meeting for early December. I spoke at this inaugural meeting,
presenting Zend Framework's MVC layer yet again; a good time was
had by all, and a lot of enthusiasm for future meetings was
generated.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I finished up Zend_Layout and Zend_View Enhanced with the help
of Ralph Schindler, and got a new proposal up for <xhtml:a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Form">Zend_Form</xhtml:a>,
just in time for my holidays to begin -- 11 days with family and
with little to no internet connectivity during a trip to Atlanta,
GA for one of only a handful of Christmases I've spent without
snow.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Summary</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>This year was <xhtml:em>incredibly</xhtml:em> busy -- three cross-seas
trips, one cross-continent trip, a move, and several trips along
the Eastern Seaboard; three user group presentations, and eight
presentations over the course of the year; one conference; one
move; one PEAR release; one podcast; one webinar; one book; and
countless hours of programming.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>My goals for the coming year? I'm too tired to even think about
it ;-).</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>Life is in transition for me now. Two weeks ago, we got to bring
our handsome baby boy home, and I haven't been sleeping much since
(though more than Jen). On top of the sleep deprivation, however,
comes more exciting news: I've been hired as a PHP Developer by
<xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend Technologies</xhtml:a>!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I was approached by Daniel Kushner in late July regarding
another position at Zend, and was flown out at the beginning of
August. While I felt the interview went well, I harbored some
doubts; work got fairly busy shortly thereafter, and then, of
course, Liam was born, and the interview went completely out of my
head. Until about three days after Liam's birthday, when Daniel
contacted me again about the PHP Developer position.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Work started yesterday, and I was flown to Zend's offices in
Cupertino, CA, for orientation and to sit down with both Daniel and
others to prepare for the projects on which I will be working.
Thankfully, the job will not require that I move, and I will be
working out of the 'home office' in Vermont when I return later
this week.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The decision to leave <xhtml:a href="http://assoc.garden.org/about">NGA</xhtml:a> was difficult, but the
opportunity to work with Zend is just too good to miss. I am
honored to be selected by them, and hope this is the beginning of
many good things to come.</xhtml:p>

    <content xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" type="xhtml">
      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>We did it... we moved, again.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>However, unlike our previous two moves, which were interstate,
this time we stayed in the same state. The same county, even. What
made (makes; we're still finishing up as I write this) this one so
jarring is the fact that we're going from the rural mountainside to
the fourth floor of a new apartment/condo building adjoining an
interstate spur.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Why would we do this?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>First, some history. In case you haven't been reading the blog,
Jen and I are having another baby. And our one-and-only car died a
few months ago (which we've since replaced). And we were living in
West Bolton, a good half-hour by car to Burlington, where we work
and often play -- which means that we've been having a long commute
each day (50 minutes, minimum, each way). And we've been spending
far more on our rent and utilities than we'd like; we haven't been
able to save at all.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>We got to thinking that this was not an ideal situation for us.
We cannot afford another car (either the initial purchase or the
ongoing expense of one), so we decided it was time to look for
something closer to town. And then, as we did, we discovered that
places were either not close enough to change the commute
significantly, or we were going to be spending the same amount of
money (or more) to live closer as we were to live up in the
mountains -- and sometimes this was with less space.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>We finally found several places we liked and which were in the
price range we were targetting, and it came down to how we felt
about our potential landlords, and they us. And the one that was
cheapest, most convenient to our workplaces, and still somewhat
reasonably sized... is the <xhtml:a href="http://www.citysedgevt.com/">brand-new apartment on the city's
edge</xhtml:a> we're currently occupying.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Our landlord is very nice, and a mortgage broker for a local
bank; yet, this is actually his first rental property. He and his
wife breed some sort of dog, and he was quite happy to have Cuervo
move in. Additionally, when we came to visit the location, Maeve
had her tiger, Talula, with her, and he liked the name so much that
he suggested it to his wife for a puppy name. It just felt like a
good fit.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Now, as I mentioned above, we've moved from the rural
mountainside to the city: we've gone from complete quiet (apart
from the peepers singing) and complete darkness (other than the
blanket of stars in the sky) to a constant hum of traffic and
lights that never shut off. But in the mountains, all we could see
was the sky above and trees surrounding us; we couldn't even see
the mountain on which we lived. The new apartment is on the top
floor, looking west... which gives us an excellent view of the
Adirondacks and a portion of Lake Champlain, as well as beautiful
sunsets.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The new location poses some challenges. The place is
significantly smaller than our place in West Bolton, and doesn't
have a full basement for storage (obviously). Plus, we're
<xhtml:em>adding</xhtml:em> to our family, yet we're reducing the number of
rooms by one. And, for pete's sake, we're on the fourth floor --
what about when Cuervo needs to pee?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Well, now that we're mostly moved in, I can answer some of these
questions. The move has been difficult, but a good experience.
We've taken it as an opportunity to simplify. Which, in a nutshell,
means, "throw out unnecessary shit." I discovered that I had four
file cabinet drawers full of old papers that I had absolutely no
use for, nor attachment to. We took several boxes of books to a
local charity, and untold numbers of clothes and toys. We've now
got just about everything over to the new place, except some stuff
from the office and some storage from the basement... and I find
myself wondering why we ever felt we needed all the things we got
rid of.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Cuervo's settling in nicely, though she's having a little
trouble understanding that she can't be as vocal. As it turns out,
Cuervo's getting old. She's now seven, and in this first week of
walks, I've discovered that in her little 'explores' up in West
Bolton, she was likely walking for up to 10 minutes, and then
sitting on her butt or outright laying down for a while before
getting up to continue. She doesn't even pull incessantly on the
leash anymore! She's certainly very healthy and in good shape, but
she simply doesn't have quite the energy and enthusiasm I remember
from walking her in years past. So, as it turns out, the move is
probably a good thing for her, too -- we interact with her more,
and also can keep a better eye on her general health.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I've also discovered that I like living near more people. Every
day, I run into people, usually while walking Cuervo. I already
know several people by name, which is several people more than I
met all of last year. Additionally, the building was built on the
edge of some property that contains four other apartment buildings,
some of which are Section 8 -- which means that when Maeve goes
down to play at the playground, she's meeting kids of many
ethnicities and economic backgrounds. (We met a couple of girls
whose family emigrated from Rwanda, for instance!)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The move has been trying in many ways, though. The sheer amount
of stuff to do has alternately overwhelmed myself and then Jen, and
we have found ourselves getting frustrated with each other quite
often. However, the common experience of our 'simplifying' process
has also drawn us together -- it's a goal we both share, and for
which we must both sacrifice. Additionally, the new place has a
layout that encourages staying connected: the kitchen, dining room,
and living room all flow into each other, and the bedrooms open off
this main room, meaning we're always within hearing distance -- and
often sight -- of each other.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, all in all, while difficult, I feel the move has been a very
good one for the family as a whole. Now if only I could turn off
the parking lot lights and passing traffic when I go to bed...</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I can't believe I haven't announced this to the world yet, but
Jen and I are expecting another baby! The due date is
mid-September. And.... we decided at the ultrasound this past week
we would go ahead and find out the gender... and....</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">It's A BOY!!!!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'm terribly excited, in case you can't tell. I'd had a dream
shortly after we found out we were pregnant that we were at the
doctor's for the ultrasound, and I'd seen quite clearly a little
penis; I've been convinced since then that we would have a boy. It
was amazing to have it confirmed -- so many emotions ran through me
-- how will I be a father to a boy, how will I teach him to shave,
will I need to learn about sports if he takes to them, IT'S A
BOY!!!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>We've been going through baby names since then. Before Maeve was
born, we'd planned on calling a boy Aidan; a couple years ago, we
though maybe Will would be a good name (Will is one of the
principal characters in Philip Pullman's <xhtml:em>His Dark
Materials</xhtml:em> trilogy). However, one of my co-workers, has two
boys -- Will and Aidan -- whom Maeve plays with, so those names are
out.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>We've narrowed the names down to four, though: Nolan, Liam,
Gavin, and Devin. Leave a comment and let us know what you
think!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Oh, did I mention -- it's a boy!!!!</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I couldn't resist... the car model demands it...</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>For those not familiar with where I live, my family and I live
in West Bolton, VT -- about 20 miles from Burlington, and at the
base of Bolton Mountain. Our daily commute is 4 miles on a dirt
road, another 3 to 4 miles on some twisty two-laners at 35mph to
the interstate, and around 10 miles on the interstate into
Burlington. Then there's all the miles in town getting Maeve to
day-care, Jen or myself dropped off, and whomever has the car to
work. And we only have one car.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, you can imagine the crisis when, almost a month ago, our
Toyota Rav4 died on the way in to work.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>We started it up that day, and it had this funny knocking sound.
I remembered a similar sound in my old pickup back in Montana...
the one that died. I determined to get it into a shop that day to
get it diagnosed. The noise came and went while we were on the
backroads, and because it wasn't constant, I figured it couldn't be
too serious.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>And then we tried to get to highway speeds.... a few miles on
the interstate, and it was evident we were in trouble. The Rav was
having trouble maintaining 60mph on the way up French Hill -- when
it normally was able to accelerate past 70mph. And the knocking
sound was getting worse and louder.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>We resolved to pull off at the first exit, at Tafts Corners in
Williston. I pulled into the first gas station there, and as we
tried to find a place to park the vehicle, a mechanic was flagging
at us to stop the car. He came over to where we parked and said,
"Sounds like you've blown your engine."</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>These, of course, were the absolute last words I wanted to
hear.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>To make a long story short, apparently a bearing was thrown when
we started the engine that day, and because we decided to drive it,
we basically destroyed the engine. The cost to replace it: around
$6,000.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Now, we're not exactly what you'd call "financially secure".
We've had a lot of transitions in the past five years, and except
for the past year and a few months, haven't typically both been
working at the same time. We've been in a perpetual cycle of having
enough to pay the bills... but having to pay consistently late. And
we haven't been able to do much, if anything, about our educational
debt. In short, our credit sucks. Which means that $6,000 is a big
deal.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Did I mention that, at the time of the incident, we still had 17
months left on our car payments?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>And, on top of it, I've been in the middle of a <xhtml:em>huge</xhtml:em>
project for work that's required a fair bit of overtime -- and very
little wiggle room for personal time?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The timing could not have been worse, either professionally or
financially.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>We've been very fortunate, however. Jen's parents very
graciously offerred to pay off our existing car loan -- which
helped tremendously. It bought us both the time to figure things
out, as well as eliminated one factor that may have barred our
ability to borrow towards repairs or a new car. Additionally, a
friend of Jen's turns out to be absolutely ruthless when it comes
to dealing with car salespeople, and went to bat for us in working
out a deal. If it hadn't been for her efforts -- and those of the
salesperson, who also went to bat for us -- we would not have
gotten more than a thousand or so for the vehicle; we ended up
getting over $3,000 for it, as is. Finally, the finance guy at the
dealership advocated for us tremendously so we could get a loan on
a new vehicle, with the Rav as our trade in.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, to conclude: We're now proud owners of a 2005 Toyota Matrix!
(And now the mystery of the title is revealed... to all you Matrix
fans out there...)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'll try to get a photo of the car up soon... about the time we
update the year-old photos on our site... :-)</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>Well, it's official: My IT Manager convinced those in the upper
echelons (well, considering it's a non-profit with only around 20
employees, that meant the president and the CFO) that (1) he and I
need to attend a PHP conference, (2) due to the amount of work
we've been putting in to bring money into the organization, cost
shouldn't be <xhtml:em>too</xhtml:em> much of a deciding factor, and (3)
<xhtml:a href="http://www.phparch.com/tropics" target="_blank">php|Tropics</xhtml:a> isn't <xhtml:em>too</xhtml:em> expensive, especially
considering the sessions involved cover some of the very issues
we've been struggling with the past few months (PHP/MySQL/Apache
and clusters, PHP5 OOP, PHP Security, test-driven development,
Smarty, and more).</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, we're going to Cancun in May!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>This is incredibly exciting! I've never been to Mexico, nor even
a resort, so I'll finally get to find out what my wife and friends
have been talking about all these years. Plus, the conference is
top-notch -- many of the presenters are well-known in the PHP
community, and have blogs I've been following for the past year. (I
only wish that Chris Shiflett's PHP Security series wasn't running
head-to-head with the PHP5 OOP Extensions and PHP 5 Patterns
sessions; I suspect Rob and I will have to do a divide-and-conquer
that day.)</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I've been extremely busy at work, and will continue to be
through the end of March. I realized this past week that I'd set a
goal of having a <xhtml:a href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_blank">SourceForge</xhtml:a> website up and running for Cgiapp by the
end of January -- and it's now mid-February. Originally, I was
going to backport some of my libraries from PHP5 to PHP4 so I could
do so... and I think that was beginning to daunt me a little.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Fortunately, I ran across a quick-and-dirty content management
solution yesterday called <xhtml:a href="http://gunther.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Gunther</xhtml:a>. It does templating in Smarty, and uses
a wiki-esque syntax for markup -- though page editing is limited to
admin users only (something I was looking for). I decided to try it
out, and within an hour or so had a working site ready to
upload.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Cgiapp's new site can be found at <xhtml:a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">cgiapp.sourceforge.net</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h4>UPDATE</xhtml:h4>
<xhtml:p>Shortly after I wrote this original post, I figured out what the
strength of Gunther was -- and why I no longer needed it. Gunther
was basically taking content entered from a form and then inserting
that content (after some processing for wiki-like syntax) into a
Smarty template. Which meant that I could do the same thing with
Cgiapp and <xhtml:a href="http://pear.php.net/text_wiki">Text_Wiki</xhtml:a>.
Within an hour, I wrote an application module in Cgiapp that did
just that, and am proud to say that the Cgiapp website is 100%
Cgiapp.</xhtml:p>
