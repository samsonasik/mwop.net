      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>My good friend, Rob, hosts my site for me, in return for helping
with server maintenance. After being on Gentoo for the past three
years, though, we decided it was time to switch to something a
little easier to maintain, so last night we wiped the system
partitions and installed Ubuntu server.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'll say this: the setup is much faster! However, we had a few
gotchas that surprised us -- it didn't setup our RAID array
out-of-the-box, which led to a good hour of frustration as we tried
to verify that the install wouldn't wipe it, and then to verify
that we could re-assemble it. (We succeeded.) Additionally, we
second-guessed a few things we shouldn't have, which led to needing
to back out and reconfigure. But what was over a 12 hour install
with Gentoo we accomplished in a matter of a few hours with Ubuntu
server -- so it was a huge success that way.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Unfortunately, our mysqldump of all databases... wasn't, a fact
we discovered only after importing it into the new system. I ended
up losing my blog database and PEAR channel database. Fortunately,
the PEAR channel has not changed at all in the past year, so we had
an old backup that worked, and I had a snapshot of my blog database
from three weeks ago I was able to use. As a result, there are a
few missing entries, but for the most part, all works. If you
commented on one of those missing entries, my apologies.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Now that the install is done, I'm also finalizing some design
changes to my blog -- it's time to leave the black and white for
more colorful grounds. Look for a revamp in the coming weeks!</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>Early in the week, I decided to avoid the release rush and go
ahead and update my laptop to <xhtml:a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu's</xhtml:a> Gutsy Gibbon release. Overall,
it's quite good, with one caveat I'll elaborate on later.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'd been having some issues with fonts following a session at
ZendCon where I hooked my laptop up to a widescreen display, and
the updates fixed all those issues. Most things that worked before
continued to work, and often in an improved way. The various new
themes available -- from GDM to GTK to window manager themes --
make for some pretty displays, and I've found a new look for my
desktop that I really like.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Among the improvements, it installed <xhtml:a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/tracker/">trackerd</xhtml:a>, a desktop
search tool. I'd tried installing this on my own before, but ran
into a ton of dependency issues I couldn't fix. Prior to this, I'd
used beagle, which worked okay, but tended to overlook a lot of
files. Trackerd, on the other hand, indexed my entire box
overnight, and stays on top of new files easily. Couple this with
the 'deskbar', and I now have the type of desktop search I've only
seen in Macs.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Last night, I stumbled upon <xhtml:a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/Xgl#head-3138701daf76c1fd11c0b68bf5745c1d1ccacca5">
a forum thread</xhtml:a> detailing how to get X compositing working with
ATI cards. This was something I've been continually disappointed
with; my card supposedly supports it, but every time I've tried
using it, I find it unusable -- lots of wierd screen artifacts, and
a huge slowdown in responsiveness. After following the directions
in the linked article, however, I now have compositing going --
window drop shadows, translucency for inactive windows, etc. It
looks really nice, and doesn't seem to be slowing down the machine
at all.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>No review would be complete without a gripe though, right? And
I've got a big one. In the past, one of the strengths of ubuntu for
me has been that suspend and hibernate have just worked. With this
upgrade, however, they no longer work for me. Evidently, a new
kernel option was enabled that is supposed to speed up these
operations... However, the available ATI drivers do not support
this option, which leads, in my case, to a complete inability to
suspend or hibernate, and for others, lockup on resume. Supposedly
ATI will be releasing new drivers that will fix the issue, but
there's no published time frame for when that will happen.
Additionally, ubuntu made no announcements about the issue, and
provides no workarounds. To me, this is a huge BC break, and should
have been addressed prior to the release, particularly as there
were many, many complaints about it in the weeks prior to the
release.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Gripes aside, I find the new functionality fantastic, and look
forward to ATI's release of new drivers for its Radeon series
cards. Perhaps this release will keep me happy enough that I won't
keep lusting for a shiny new Macbook too much.</xhtml:p>
