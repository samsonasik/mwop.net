      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    Last Friday and Saturday I spent at <a
        href="http://phpconference.nl/">the Dutch PHP Conference</a>, hosted by
    <a href="http://ibuildings.nl/">Ibuildings</a>. Unfortunately, I had very
    little time to blog while there. I'd prepared my outlines and basic slides
    before heading to the conference, but had a large number of screenshots and
    images to prepare that kept me up until the wee hours of the morning each
    day. In addition, the conference was extremely well organized -- which meant
    that any time not spent speaking was spent interacting with attendees or
    other speakers -- never a bad thing!
</p><p>
    First off, the big impression I had when the conference finished is that
    either PHP developers in Holland are incredibly professional, or that the
    best practices advocated by various community leaders are finally taking
    hold. My last talk was one addressing development best practices, and I was
    constantly amazed at how many people were <em>already</em> using most if not
    all the best practices I touched on in my talk. This is really fantastic
    news, as far as I'm concerned; hopefully all those PHP detractors out there
    are going to start taking notice that PHP development has matured, and, in
    fact become very quality oriented. Here's that presentation:
</p>

<div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_472388"><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=20080614bestpractices-1213726335523088-9"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=20080614bestpractices-1213726335523088-9" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object><div style="font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed"><img src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png" style="border:0px none;margin-bottom:-5px" alt="SlideShare"/></a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/weierophinney/everyday-best-practices-of-php-development?src=embed" title="View Everyday Best Practices of PHP Development on SlideShare">View</a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/upload?src=embed">Upload your own</a></div></div>

<p>
    The big event for me, of course, was the full day Zend Framework workshop.
    My two regrets: a) not having a better script for the final hour, when I
    covered a simple demo bugapp used for developing the workshop, and b)
    running opposite <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de">Sebastian
        Bergmann</a> -- as I wanted to see what he's been working on recently
    with <a href="http://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>. That said, I feel the
    workshop went over very well; I was able to finish each section early enough
    that we had time for 5 - 15 minutes of questions over the material just
    covered, and there were excellent questions from those attending. The funny
    part was that with two of the questions, I simply fired up my browser to the
    tutorials I wrote on <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/">DevZone</a>, and
    used the examples and materials from them to answer the questions.
</p>

<div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_472382"><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=20080613zendframeworkworkshop-1213725963433006-9"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=20080613zendframeworkworkshop-1213725963433006-9" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object><div style="font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed"><img src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png" style="border:0px none;margin-bottom:-5px" alt="SlideShare"/></a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/weierophinney/zend-framework-workshop?src=embed" title="View Zend Framework Workshop on SlideShare">View</a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/upload?src=embed">Upload your own</a></div></div>

<p>
    As promised, I've <a href="/uploads/bugapp.tar.gz">uploaded the bug application</a> I worked up to
    create the session. Be aware that it's incomplete; the main thing was to see
    how each of the various pieces could interact so I'd know what to cover and
    when in the workshop.
</p>

<p>
    Following the night of the workshops, Ibuildings had a dinner for their
    employees, and I was invited to tag along. I had some great conversations
    with <a href="http://www.lornajane.net">Lorna Jane</a> and one of her
    colleagues, Bill, discussing topics ranging from family to training, from
    travel to PHP, and more. Dinner was timed to end as the big match between
    Holland and France began, and all I have to say about that is: if you've
    never witnessed the fans of a big football match in Holland when Oranje is
    winning, you haven't lived. 'Nuff said. :-)
</p>

<p>
    I had a number of good conversations with a variety of people, really --
    <a href="http://inside.e-novative.de/">Stefan Priebsch</a>, 
    <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian</a>, 
    <a href="http://suraski.net/blog/">Zeev</a>, 
    <a href="http://mtabini.blogspot.com">Marco Tabini</a>, 
    Lorna Jane, Stefan Koopfmanschap, 
    <a href="http://www.aide-de-camp.org/">Fabien Potencier</a>, and more. 
    (Believe it or not, you <em>can</em> get more than one framework lead in the
    same room and have things stay civil; Fabien and I swapped some information
    regarding plans for our next major releases, what issues we've seen, and
    what features we're excited about.) <a href="http://felix.phpbelgium.be/blog/">Felix De Vliegher</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.dragonbe.com/">Michelangelo Van Damme</a>
    were also there, representing PHP Belgium, and it was great to hear how
    their region's PHP community is starting to come together.
</p>

<p>
    I also got a chance to meet a few people from the Zend Framework lists and
    IRC in person: Andries Seutens, Jurrien Stutterheim, and Bart McLeod -- and
    a few others whose names I most regrettably forget. I wish I could have had
    more time to talk with each of you, and discuss your projects more.
</p>

<p>
    Now, while the conference was fantastic, probably the best part for me
    personally was the day prior. My good friend <a href="http://www.wolerized.com/">Remi</a>, with whom I've worked on
    some projects at Zend a number of times over the past year, came up from
    Gouda to hang with me for the day. We walked all over the city -- through
    the Vondelpark, up by the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museums, along and
    over countless canals, near (but not through) the red light district, by the
    RAI (where the conference was held) and all the way up to Grand Centraal. I
    complained about sore feet and legs all weekend, but it was the best tour I
    could have imagined of the city, and one I shan't forget any time soon.
    And the reason we went to Grand Centraal was to meet up with 
    <a href="http://www.leftontheweb.com/">Stefan Koopmanschap</a>, with whom we
    would then have dinner and drinks that night. I feel very fortunate to have
    had the chance to spend some uninterrupted time with each of these fantastic
    developers and individuals.
</p>

<p>
    So, the short summary: excellent conference, excellent friends, excellent
    city. Looking forward to DPC '09!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    I've known for some time, but was reluctant to blog about it until the plane
    tickets were purchased and in hand: I've been invited to speak at the 
    <a href="http://phpconference.nl/">Dutch PHP Conference</a> this coming
    June:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://phpconference.nl/img/dpc08/logoDPC08_small.png" alt="DPC" height="149" width="217" />
</p>

<p>
    I'll be presenting two separate sessions: 
    <a href="http://phpconference.nl/workshops/">an all day tutorial</a> 
    on 13 June 2008 covering Zend Framework, and a regular session on 14 June
    2008 covering 
    <a href="http://phpconference.nl/schedule/bestpractices">Best Practices for PHP development</a>, 
    which will focus on how to utilize Zend Framework coding standards and
    methodologies to help deliver efficient, high quality code for your
    organization.
</p>

<p>
    I'm looking forward to meeting old and new friends alike at the conference!

      <title>ZendCon is over at last</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon '07</a> is finally over, the dust
    has settled, and I finally find myself with some time alone... practically
    the first I've had since Sunday. The week was fantastic, and I had many good
    conversations and brainstorming sessions. Oh, and I ended up giving three
    different sessions, so it's time for links to slides and materials:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-BestPractices.odp">Best Practices of PHP Development</a>. 
        <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian</a>, 
        <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike</a>, and I presented a full-day
        tutorial on PHP development best practices, focussing primarily on
        testing and testing strategies, but also covering coding standards,
        usage of SCM tools, and deployment. There were a ton of questions from
        the attendees, and Sebastian even whipped out some extra slides at the
        end showing new and little-known features of PHPUnit. Basically, reading
        the slides won't really indicate what we covered, but is more of a
        general outline. It was an honor and pleasure to work with Sebastian and
        Mike on this, and I hope we can do it again in the future some time.
    </li>

    <li><a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-MVC.ppt">Zend Framework MVC Quick Start</a>.
        This was basically the same session I did in my <a href="http://www.zend.com/webinar">webinar</a>
        a couple weeks ago, with a few corrections and a small demonstration.
        Cal put me on directly following <a href="http://terrychay.com/blog">Terry Chay</a>,
        in the largest of the four session rooms -- the one where all the
        keynotes occurred -- talk about intimidating! Amazingly, the session was
        really well attended -- others I talked to estimate between 100 and 150
        people showed up. The most amazing part, though, was that when I asked
        how many people knew what 'MVC' was, I don't think there was a single
        person who didn't raise their hand -- definitely a sign of how well
        accepted the pattern now is in PHP.
    </li>

    <li><a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-AjaxPresentation.odp">AJAX-Enabling Your Zend Framework Controllers</a>.
        I did this talk for the <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Uncon">Unconference</a>,
        mainly because its a topic I've been interested in and wanted to
        present. In it, I detailed how to ajax-enable an application through
        some easy tricks with Action and View Helpers and using JS to decorate
        your existing application. The reference app I used was a pastebin, and
        I've got code for both <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a> and 
        <a href="http://prototypejs.org">Prototype</a> flavors available:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/uploads/PastebinDojo.tar.gz">Dojo pastebin</a></li>
            <li><a href="/uploads/PastebinPrototype.tar.gz">Prototype pastebin</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The two highlight keynote speakers, for me, were definitely 
    <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> and
    <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>. Neither spoke about PHP,
    but both spoke about topics that PHP developers should take to heart.
    Perhaps I'll elaborate on those in another post.
</p>

<p>
    Another bonus for me was the number of old and new friends alike I got to
    see -- I had many good conversations with Paul M. Jones, Nate Abele, Ivo
    Jansch, and Ralph Schindler, and opportunities to finally meet fellow
    co-author Lig Turmelle, Ben Ramsey, Chris Shifflet (dude, we've been to four
    conferences together, and never yet met!), and many, many others. I was also
    overwhelmed by the number of Zend Framework users who sought me out either
    to ask me questions or simply thank me and the others on the team for the
    project; I'm deeply honored that I can work on a project that affects so
    many developers.
</p>

<p>
    And now for some down time to recuperate...

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    I don't know why I haven't blogged this sooner, but, yes, I'll be speaking
    once again at <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon:</a>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.zend.com.com" ><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/zendcon/ZendCon07_SpeakerBadge.gif" border="0"></a></p>

<p>
    I'll be presenting a number of times:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>On Monday, I join <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian Bergmann</a> 
        and <a href="http://naberezny.com/">Mike Naberezny</a> in a full-day
        tutorial session on PHP Development Best Practices and Unit Testing.
        This expands on what Mike and I did last year, and will more heavily
        emphasize the role of testing in the development process -- arguably the
        most important best practice you can adopt.</li>
    <li>On Tuesday monrning, I'll present a Zend Framework MVC Quick Start. This
        talk is based on a <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/144-Zend-Framework-MVC-Webinar-posted.html">webinar</a> 
        I recently gave for Zend, and covers the various pieces of the MVC layer
        in Zend Framework.
    </li>
    <li>Tuesday evening, I'll present an <a href="http://zendcon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Uncon">Unconference</a>
        session on Ajax-enabling your Zend Framework controllers. I don't know
        yet if I'll need the whole hour, but I can probably fill it up with some
        examples of decorating your apps with AJAX.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Looking forward to seeing you all there!
