      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I've been using <xhtml:a href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</xhtml:a> for
some time now, and appreciate how easy it makes both connecting to
wifi as well as VPNs. That said, I've had an issue with it that I
only resolved today.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>When working from home, I prefer to use a VPN split tunnel setup
-- I'm behind a firewall all the time, and it's useful to be able
to run virtual machines while still connected to my VPN (e.g., when
doing training or webinar sessions). However, I noticed some months
ago that this wasn't working. I assumed at first it was a change in
our network setup, but others reported that the split tunnel was
working fine. It's been particularly problematic when on IRC -- if
the VPN drops, I lose my IRC connection, meaning I have to
re-connect and re-claim my nick.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, I did some searching, and found an interesting setting. In
NetworkManager, "Configure..." then "Edit" your VPN connection, and
navigate to the "IPv4 Settings" tab. Once there, click the button
that says "Routes..." and select the checkbox next to "Use this
connection only for resources on its network". Press Ok to close
the dialog, then "Apply" to exit out of the VPN configuration.
Re-connect to the VPN, and you should be all set.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p><xhtml:em>Note: this will only work if your VPN server is configured
to allow split tunnels. Additionally, only do so if you are behind
a firewall. Practice safe networking.</xhtml:em></xhtml:p>
