    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I may work at <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a>, but I've never been a
    fan of IDEs. They simply don't suit my programming style. I can usually keep
    track of file locations in my head pretty easily, and what I really need is
    a blank slate on which I can write, and one that doesn't consume resource
    that can better be used running web servers and other programs. Syntax
    highlighting, good indentation -- these are important, but you can get these
    from good, minimal text editors very easily. 
    <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim is my editor of choice</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I will admit, though, that one area where I have had IDE-envy is the area of
    code completion. I often find myself doing quick lookups to php.net or
    perldoc to determine the order of arguments to a function or method call,
    or checking for the expected return value. Most of the time, this doesn't
    take much time, however, so I just live with it.
</p>
<p>
    Today, however, cruising through the blogosphere, I came across 
    <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/09/visual-walk-through-of-couple-of-new.html">an article showcasing some new features of Vim 7.0</a>, 
    and discovered Vim 7's code completion.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, while in insert mode, you can type &lt;C-x&gt; &lt;C-o&gt; to
    have vim attempt to autocomplete the current keyword. If more than one
    possibility exists, it shows a dropdown, and you can use your arrow keys to
    highlight the keyword that you wish to use.
</p>
<p>
    But it gets better! Not only does it do this kind of autocompletion, but it
    also opens a small 'scratch preview' pane showing the function/method
    signature -- i.e., the expected arguments and return value!
</p>
<p>
    I thought I had little need for IDEs before... now I have even less! Bram
    and the rest of the Vim team, my hat's off to you for more fine work!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I upgraded <a href="http://www.s9y.org/">Serendipity</a> today, due to the
    recent announcement of the 1.0 release, as well as to combat some rampant
    issues with trackback spam.
</p>
<p>
    I've been very happy with Serendipity so far; it just runs, and the default
    install gives just what you need to get a blog up and running, and nothing
    more; any extra functionality comes via plugins which you, the blogger, get
    to decide upon.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, it's incredibly easy to upgrade. Unpack the tarball, rsync
    it over your existing install (I rsync it, because I don't use 'serendipity'
    as my directory name), visit the admin, boom, you're done. I've upgraded
    several times, and never lost data, nor configuration settings. 
</p>
<p>
    My primary reason for the upgrade was, as noted earlier, to combat trackback
    spam. As of this morning, I had 15,000 pending trackbacks, none of which
    appeared to be valid (if any of them were, and you're not seeing yours, I'm
    very sorry; I deleted them <em>en masse</em>). These had accumulated in <em>less than
    a month</em> -- that's an average of about one every 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
    Since upgrading, and using the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>
    service, I've received not a single spam trackback. Needless to say, I'm
    happy I performed the upgrade!
</p>
<p>
    If you're a Serendipity user, and haven't upgraded to 1.0.0 yet (or one of
    it's reportedly very stable release candidates), do it today -- you have
    nothing to lose, and a lot of lost time to gain!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I ran across a blog post entitled "<a href="http://blog.develix.com/frog/user/cliff/article/2006-06-04/9">Why the Light Has Gone Out on LAMP</a>" 
    earlier today, and felt compelled to respond.
</p>
<p>
    First, a rant: somehow, this article got posted on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>. 
    I've never heard of the guy who posted it, and some quick googling shows
    that he's a pythoner. He's simply fueling the language wars, and the
    slashdot post opened up a huge debate that need not have occurred. I think
    it was irresponsible of the Slashdot editors to post it.
</p>
<p>
    In the post, the author makes an analogy of using PHP + MySQL as the
    equivalent of using BASIC, and then uses a quote that claims BASIC "has
    become the leading cause of brain-damage in proto-hackers." 
</p>
<p>
    I'm sorry, but using a language doesn't cause brain damage. And there are
    many levels to programming. And using Python, Ruby, C, C++, Java, etc., does
    not automatically make you a better programmer than those using one of
    "those other languages". You can write crap code in any language. You can
    also write great code in just about any language.
</p>
<p>
    Programming takes practice; programming well takes a lot of practice. You
    get better at it by learning more about programming practices, and applying
    them to your language. Part of programming is also learning when a
    particular language is suited to a task, and when it isn't. Python works for
    the web, but it's not particularly suited to it; similarly, you can write
    web servers in PHP, but that doesn't mean you should.
</p>
<p>
    Stop the language wars already! Stop writing incendiary pieces about a
    language you don't use regularly or never gained particular proficiency in,
    and code already!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/107-Telcos-are-Attacking-the-Internet.html">Telcos are Attacking the Internet</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I generally try to stay out of politics on this blog, but this time
    something has to be said, as it affects anyone who uses the internet, at
    least in the US.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, a number of telcos and cable providers are talking about charging
    internet content providers -- the places you browse to on the internet,
    places like Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, etc. -- fees to ensure bandwidth to
    their sites. Their argument is that these content providers are getting a
    'free ride' on their lines, and generating a lot of traffic themselves, and
    should thus be paying for the cost of bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
    This is patently ridiculous. Content providers already have to pay for their
    bandwidth -- they, too, have ISPs or agreements with telcos in place, either
    explicitly or via their hosting providers. Sure, some of them, particularly
    search engines, send out robots in order to index or find content, but,
    again, they're paying for the bandwidth those robots generate.
    Additionally, people using the internet are typically paying for bandwidth
    as well, through their relationship with their ISP. What this amounts to is
    the telcos getting paid not just by each person to whom they provide
    internet access, but every end point on the internet, at least those within
    the US.
</p>
<p>
    What this is really about is telcos wanting more money, and wanting to push
    their own content. As an example, let's say your ISP is AOL. AOL is part of
    Time Warner, and thus has ties to those media sources. Now, those media
    sources may put pressure on AOL to reduce bandwidth to sites operated by
    ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, Disney, PBS, etc. This might mean that your kid can no
    longer visit the Sesame Street website reliably, because AOL has reduced the
    amount of bandwidth allowed to that service -- but any media site in the TWC
    would get optimal access, so they could get to Cartoon Network. Not to slam
    Cartoon Network (I love it), but would you rather have your kid visiting
    cartoonnetwork.com or pbskids.org?  Basically, content providers would not
    need to compete based on the value of their content, but on who they can get
    to subscribe to their service.
</p>
<p>
    Here's another idea: your ISP is MSN. You want to use Google... but MSN has
    limited the bandwidth to Google because it's a competitor, and won't accept
    any amount of money to increase that bandwidth. They do the same with Yahoo!
    So, now you're limited to MSN search, because that's the only one that
    responds reliably -- regardless of whether or not you like their search
    results. By doing so, they've just artificially inflated the value of their
    search engine -- without needing to compete based on merit. 
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, let's say Barnes and Noble has paid MSN to ensure good
    bandwidth, but part of that agreement is a non-compete clause.  Now you find
    your connections to Amazon timing out, meaning that you can't even see which
    book provider has the better price on the book you want; you're stuck
    looking and buying from B&amp;N.
</p>
<p>
    Now, let's look at something a little more close to home for those of us
    developing web applications. There have been a number of success stories the
    last few years: MySpace, Digg, and Flickr all come to mind. Would these
    endeavors have been as successful had they needed to pay multiple times for
    bandwidth, once to their ISP and once each to each telco charging for
    content providers? Indeed, some of these are still free services -- how
    would they ever have been able to pay the extra amounts to the telcos in the
    first place?
</p>
<p>
    So, basically, the only winners here are the telcos.
</p>
<p>
    Considering how ludicrous this scheme is, one must be thinking, isn't the US
    Government going to step in and regulate against such behaviour? <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2006/tc20060426_553893.htm?chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today">The answer, sadly, is no.</a>
    The GOP doesn't like regulation, and so they want market forces to decide.
    Sadly, what this will likely do is force a number of content providers to
    offshore their internet operations -- which is likely to have some pretty
    negative effects on the economy.
</p>
<p>
    The decision isn't final -- efforts can still be made to prevent it (the
    above link references a Senate committee meeting; there's been no vote on
    it). Call your representatives today and give them an earful. Tell them it's
    not just about regulation of the industry, but about fair competition in the
    market. Allowing the telcos to extort money from content providers will only
    reduce the US' economic chances in the world, and stifle innovation and
    choice.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Those of you who know me well know that I've been using Linux as my primary
    OS for many years now. At this point, for me, using Windows is like deciding
    I'm going to use a limited vocabulary; I can get the idea across, but not
    quite as well.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the nature of where I work and the fact that I'm telecommuting, I've
    been having to maintain a dual-boot system. I use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> for my daily OS, and boot into
    Windows when I need to interact with people at work via <a href="http://www.webex.com/">Webex</a> or 
    <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> (we're using the new Skype beta
    with video, and it only works on Windows XP at this time).
</p>
<p>
    This week, however, I've had to stay on Windows quite a bit -- lots of
    impromptu conference calls and such. So, I've been customizing my
    environment, and been pretty pleased with the results.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Life is in transition for me now. Two weeks ago, we got to bring our
    handsome baby boy home, and I haven't been sleeping much since (though more
    than Jen). On top of the sleep deprivation, however, comes more exciting
    news: I've been hired as a PHP Developer by <a
        href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend Technologies</a>!
</p>
<p>
    I was approached by Daniel Kushner in late July regarding another position
    at Zend, and was flown out at the beginning of August. While I felt the
    interview went well, I harbored some doubts; work got fairly busy shortly
    thereafter, and then, of course, Liam was born, and the interview went
    completely out of my head. Until about three days after Liam's birthday,
    when Daniel contacted me again about the PHP Developer position.
</p>
<p>
    Work started yesterday, and I was flown to Zend's offices in Cupertino, CA,
    for orientation and to sit down with both Daniel and others to prepare for
    the projects on which I will be working. Thankfully, the job will not
    require that I move, and I will be working out of the 'home office' in
    Vermont when I return later this week.
</p>
<p>
    The decision to leave <a href="http://assoc.garden.org/about">NGA</a> was
    difficult, but the opportunity to work with Zend is just too good to miss. I
    am honored to be selected by them, and hope this is the beginning of many
    good things to come.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been extremely busy at work, and will continue to be through the end of
    March. I realized this past week that I'd set a goal of having a <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_blank">SourceForge</a> website up
    and running for Cgiapp by the end of January -- and it's now mid-February.
    Originally, I was going to backport some of my libraries from PHP5 to PHP4
    so I could do so... and I think that was beginning to daunt me a little. 
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, I ran across a quick-and-dirty content management solution
    yesterday called <a href="http://gunther.sourceforge.net/"
        target="_blank">Gunther</a>. It does templating in Smarty, and uses a
    wiki-esque syntax for markup -- though page editing is limited to admin
    users only (something I was looking for). I decided to try it out, and
    within an hour or so had a working site ready to upload.
</p>
<p>
    Cgiapp's new site can be found at <a
        href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">cgiapp.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p>

<h4>UPDATE</h4>
<p>
    Shortly after I wrote this original post, I figured out what the strength of
    Gunther was -- and why I no longer needed it. Gunther was basically taking
    content entered from a form and then inserting that content (after some
    processing for wiki-like syntax) into a Smarty template. Which meant that I
    could do the same thing with Cgiapp and <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/text_wiki">Text_Wiki</a>. Within an hour, I
    wrote an application module in Cgiapp that did just that, and am proud to
    say that the Cgiapp website is 100% Cgiapp.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I picked up on <a href="http://osdir.com/slash3344.html">this article</a> on
    Friday, glanced through it and moved on, but noticed this evening it had
    been <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/08/2129250&tid=185">slashdotted</a>
    -- at which point I realized the author is the current <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/06/05/cgi.html">CGI::Application</a>
    maintainer, so I looked again.  </p> <p> At my first glance through it, it
    appeared the author was looking for a nice, easy-to-use pre-processor script
    for generating a site out of templates and content files. To that end, he,
    in the end, recommended <em>ttree</em>, part of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~abw/Template-Toolkit-2.14/">Template
        Toolkit</a> distribution.
</p>
<p>
    However, the real gist of the article -- something that should probably have
    been summarized at the end -- is that the author was looking for an free and
    OSS replacement for DreamWeaver's Templates functionality. This
    functionality allows a developer to create a template with placeholders for
    content, lock it, and then create pages that have the bits and pieces of
    content. Finally, the developer compiles the site -- creating final HTML
    pages out of the content merged with the templates.
</p>
<p>
    Now, I can see something like this being useful. I've used <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/JMASON/HTML-WebMake-2.2/webmake.raw">webmake</a>
    for a couple of projects, and, obviously, utilize PHP in many places as a
    templating language. However, several comments on Slashdot also gave some
    pause. The tone of these comments was to the effect of, "real developers
    shouldn't use DW; they should understand HTML and code it directly." Part of
    me felt this was elitist -- the web is such an egalitarian medium that there
    should be few barriers to entry. However, the <em>webmaster</em> in me --
    the professional who gets paid each pay period and makes a living off the
    web -- also agreed with this substantially.
</p>
<p>
    I've worked -- both professionally and as a freelancer -- with individuals
    who use and rely on DW. The problem I see with the tool and others of its
    breed is precisely their empowerment of people. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>
    I really do feel anybody should be able to have a presence on the 'net.
    However, HTML is a fragile language: trivial errors can cause tremendous
    changes in how a page is rendered -- and even crash browsers on occasion.
    The problem I see is that DW and other GUI webpage applications create, from
    my viewpoint, garbage HTML. I cannot tell you how many pages generated by
    these applications that I've had to clean up and reformat. They spuriously
    add tags, often around empty content, that are simply unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is compounded when individuals have neither time nor inclination
    to learn HTML, but continue using the tool to create pages. They get a false
    sense of accomplishment -- that can be quickly followed by a very real sense
    of incompetence when the page inexplicably breaks due to an edit they've
    made -- especially when the content is part of a larger framework that
    includes other files. Of course, as a web professional, I get paid to fix
    such mistakes. But I feel that this does everybody a disservice -- the
    individual/company has basically paid twice for the presentation of content
    -- once to the person generating it, a second time to me to fix the errors.
</p>
<p>
    This is a big part of the reason why I've been leaning more and more heavily
    on database-driven web applications. Content then goes into the database,
    and contains minimal -- if any -- markup. It is then injected into
    templates, which go through a formal review process, as well as through the
    <a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a> validators, to prevent display
    problems. This puts everybody in a position of strength: the editor
    generating content, the designer creating the look-and-feel, and the
    programmer developing the methods for mapping content with the templates.
</p>
<p>
    There's still a part of me that struggles with what I perceive as an elitist
    position. However, there's another part of me that has struggled heavily
    with the multitasking demands made on all web professionals -- we're
    expected to be editors, graphic designers, programmers, and more. In most
    cases, we're lucky if we're strong in one or two such areas, much less
    passionate about staying abreast of the changing face of our medium.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    It's now been confirmed: I'm a geek. 
</p>
<p>
    Okay, so that probably comes as no shocker to those of you who know me, but
    it's the little things that make me realize it myself.
</p>
<p>
    I've been frequenting <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a> for
    a couple of years now, mainly to garner ideas and code to help me with my
    personal or work projects. I rarely post comments, and I've only once
    submitted a question to the site. However, I <strong>do</strong> frequent
    the site regularly, and the few comments I've put in -- generally regarding
    usage of <a href="http::/search.cpan.org/search?query=CGI%3A%3AApplication">CGI::Application</a>
    -- have been typically well-moderated.
</p>
<p>
    Well, yesterday I <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=408255">made a comment</a> to a user <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=408231">asking about editors to
        use with perl</a>. I was incensed by a remark he made about <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> not having the features he needed.
    Now, as I said in my comment, I've used VIM on a daily basis for over two
    years, and I'm <em>still</em> discovering new features -- and I've used all
    of the features he was looking for.
</p>
<p>
    This is where I discovered I'm a geek: my comment made it into the <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=Best%20Nodes">Daily
    Best</a> for today, peaking around number 5. The fact that that made my day
    indicates to me that I <em>must</em> be a geek.
</p>
<p>
    Oh -- and VIM rules!
