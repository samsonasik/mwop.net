      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>Last Friday and Saturday I spent at <xhtml:a href="http://phpconference.nl/">the Dutch PHP Conference</xhtml:a>, hosted by
<xhtml:a href="http://ibuildings.nl/">Ibuildings</xhtml:a>. Unfortunately, I
had very little time to blog while there. I'd prepared my outlines
and basic slides before heading to the conference, but had a large
number of screenshots and images to prepare that kept me up until
the wee hours of the morning each day. In addition, the conference
was extremely well organized -- which meant that any time not spent
speaking was spent interacting with attendees or other speakers --
never a bad thing!</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I've known for some time, but was reluctant to blog about it
until the plane tickets were purchased and in hand: I've been
invited to speak at the <xhtml:a href="http://phpconference.nl/">Dutch
PHP Conference</xhtml:a> this coming June:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p style="text-align: center"><xhtml:img src="http://phpconference.nl/img/dpc08/logoDPC08_small.png" alt="DPC" height="149" width="217"/></xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'll be presenting two separate sessions: <xhtml:a href="http://phpconference.nl/workshops/">an all day tutorial</xhtml:a> on 13
June 2008 covering Zend Framework, and a regular session on 14 June
2008 covering <xhtml:a href="http://phpconference.nl/schedule/bestpractices">Best Practices for
PHP development</xhtml:a>, which will focus on how to utilize Zend
Framework coding standards and methodologies to help deliver
efficient, high quality code for your organization.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'm looking forward to meeting old and new friends alike at the
conference!</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p><xhtml:a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon '07</xhtml:a> is finally
over, the dust has settled, and I finally find myself with some
time alone... practically the first I've had since Sunday. The week
was fantastic, and I had many good conversations and brainstorming
sessions. Oh, and I ended up giving three different sessions, so
it's time for links to slides and materials:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-BestPractices.odp">Best
Practices of PHP Development</xhtml:a>. <xhtml:a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian</xhtml:a>, <xhtml:a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike</xhtml:a>, and I presented a full-day
tutorial on PHP development best practices, focussing primarily on
testing and testing strategies, but also covering coding standards,
usage of SCM tools, and deployment. There were a ton of questions
from the attendees, and Sebastian even whipped out some extra
slides at the end showing new and little-known features of PHPUnit.
Basically, reading the slides won't really indicate what we
covered, but is more of a general outline. It was an honor and
pleasure to work with Sebastian and Mike on this, and I hope we can
do it again in the future some time.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-MVC.ppt">Zend Framework MVC
Quick Start</xhtml:a>. This was basically the same session I did in my
<xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com/webinar">webinar</xhtml:a> a couple weeks
ago, with a few corrections and a small demonstration. Cal put me
on directly following <xhtml:a href="http://terrychay.com/blog">Terry
Chay</xhtml:a>, in the largest of the four session rooms -- the one where
all the keynotes occurred -- talk about intimidating! Amazingly,
the session was really well attended -- others I talked to estimate
between 100 and 150 people showed up. The most amazing part,
though, was that when I asked how many people knew what 'MVC' was,
I don't think there was a single person who didn't raise their hand
-- definitely a sign of how well accepted the pattern now is in
PHP.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-AjaxPresentation.odp">AJAX-Enabling Your
Zend Framework Controllers</xhtml:a>. I did this talk for the <xhtml:a href="http://www.zendcon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Uncon">Unconference</xhtml:a>,
mainly because its a topic I've been interested in and wanted to
present. In it, I detailed how to ajax-enable an application
through some easy tricks with Action and View Helpers and using JS
to decorate your existing application. The reference app I used was
a pastebin, and I've got code for both <xhtml:a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</xhtml:a> and <xhtml:a href="http://prototypejs.org">Prototype</xhtml:a> flavors available:
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/PastebinDojo.tar.gz">Dojo pastebin</xhtml:a></xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="/uploads/PastebinPrototype.tar.gz">Prototype
pastebin</xhtml:a></xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>The two highlight keynote speakers, for me, were definitely
<xhtml:a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</xhtml:a> and
<xhtml:a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</xhtml:a>. Neither spoke
about PHP, but both spoke about topics that PHP developers should
take to heart. Perhaps I'll elaborate on those in another post.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Another bonus for me was the number of old and new friends alike
I got to see -- I had many good conversations with Paul M. Jones,
Nate Abele, Ivo Jansch, and Ralph Schindler, and opportunities to
finally meet fellow co-author Lig Turmelle, Ben Ramsey, Chris
Shifflet (dude, we've been to four conferences together, and never
yet met!), and many, many others. I was also overwhelmed by the
number of Zend Framework users who sought me out either to ask me
questions or simply thank me and the others on the team for the
project; I'm deeply honored that I can work on a project that
affects so many developers.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>And now for some down time to recuperate...</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I don't know why I haven't blogged this sooner, but, yes, I'll
be speaking once again at <xhtml:a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon:</xhtml:a></xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p style="text-align:center;"><xhtml:a href="http://www.zend.com.com"><xhtml:img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/zendcon/ZendCon07_SpeakerBadge.gif" border="0"/></xhtml:a></xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'll be presenting a number of times:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>On Monday, I join <xhtml:a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian Bergmann</xhtml:a> and <xhtml:a href="http://naberezny.com/">Mike Naberezny</xhtml:a> in a full-day tutorial
session on PHP Development Best Practices and Unit Testing. This
expands on what Mike and I did last year, and will more heavily
emphasize the role of testing in the development process --
arguably the most important best practice you can adopt.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>On Tuesday monrning, I'll present a Zend Framework MVC Quick
Start. This talk is based on a <xhtml:a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/144-Zend-Framework-MVC-Webinar-posted.html">
webinar</xhtml:a> I recently gave for Zend, and covers the various pieces
of the MVC layer in Zend Framework.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Tuesday evening, I'll present an <xhtml:a href="http://zendcon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Uncon">Unconference</xhtml:a>
session on Ajax-enabling your Zend Framework controllers. I don't
know yet if I'll need the whole hour, but I can probably fill it up
with some examples of decorating your apps with AJAX.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>Looking forward to seeing you all there!</xhtml:p>
