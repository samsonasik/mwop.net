already starting to associate names with people!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Just now, Jen was holding Liam, and turned him to face Maeve and
I, who were sitting on the couch. He wasn't looking anywhere in
particular. Then, Jen said, "Hi, Papa!" and his eyes moved to focus
on me. A moment later, she said, "Hi, big sister!" and he moved is
eyes to focus on Maeve.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>As I type this, Jen just tried the experiment again with Maeve,
and again he moved his eyes and head to look at her!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>How cool and amazing it is to witness child development!</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>This past year, Maeve had a month-long unit on Safaris and
jungle animals at daycare. One day, she came home singing:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:blockquote><xhtml:i>On Safari, on Safari,<xhtml:br/>
In a jeep, in a jeep,<xhtml:br/>
I can see a lion, I will take a picture,<xhtml:br/>
Click, click, click. Click, click, click.<xhtml:br/>
<xhtml:br/>
On Safari, on Safari,<xhtml:br/>
In a jeep, in a jeep,<xhtml:br/>
I can see a tiger, I will take a picture,<xhtml:br/>
Click, click, click. Click, click, click.</xhtml:i></xhtml:blockquote>
<xhtml:p>And so on.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>There's a place just over the Quebec border called <xhtml:a href="http://www.parcsafari.com">Parc Safari</xhtml:a> that we've been hearing
about, and today we went up there on a family outing -- one of the
last that we'll have with just the three of us (before little Liam
is born).</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:blockquote><xhtml:i>On Safari, on Safari,<xhtml:br/>
In our Matrix, in our Matrix,<xhtml:br/>
I can see a zebra, I will take a picture,<xhtml:br/>
Click, click, click. Click, click, click.<xhtml:br/></xhtml:i></xhtml:blockquote>
<xhtml:p>Needless to say, the excursion was a hit for the whole family.
The park has a drive-through safari adventure where you drive your
car through a small preserve, looking at animals and even getting a
chance to feed some of them. We saw zebras, elephants, rhinos,
ostriches, water buffalo, ibexes, camels, giraffes, emu, oryx,
reindeer, caribou, elk, bison, yaks, wildebeests... and many more
that I'm either forgetting or didn't know the names of.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The highlight of the safari was probably towards the end, when
we each of us got chances to feed bison from the car -- try
<xhtml:em>that</xhtml:em> in Yellowstone! The bison were surprisingly gentle,
and typically tried to take the food nuggets from your hand with
their lips, but the greedier ones used their tongues and tended to
exude tremendous amounts of slobber in the process.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>(My personal favorite, though, was getting the chance to stroke
a camel's whiskers. I don't know why, but it was just one of those
great moments.)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Parc Safari also has a small amusement park, with very cheap
prices ($2 Canadian per person for all day access to all rides), so
Maeve got a chance to ride to her hearts delight. She and I went on
the Ferris wheel together, and had an excellent time waving at Jen,
who awaited us below.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>If we had any doubts about Maeve enjoying it, they were allayed
when, shortly after crossing the US border, we looked back in time
to see Maeve pass out from sheer exhaustion. What a sweet kid...
the chocolate from the ice cream was still smudged on her cheek,
and her hand was gripping her memento rock.</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>Not long ago, as Maeve and I were en route to Jen's work one
evening, Maeve was being very insistent that certain things were a
certain way, and was very adamant even as I used a placating tone
with her. I asked her, jokingly, "Why are you so contrary today?"
Her reply?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>"Because I'm so smart, and because I'm so right."</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I almost wrecked the car as I guffawed. Kids. They're so dang
cute. And so right!</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>So, last night, Maeve fell asleep in the early evening, on the
couch, clutching her sippy cup and sucking on her bink while
watching Scooby Doo. She woke up an hour later, and after she'd
been up for a while and was less groggy, she announced to Jen and
me that, "I'm not going to use my bink ANY MORE. Every little girl
has to give up the bink some time, when they're four, so I'm not
going to use the bink EVER AGAIN." (Imagine dramatic pauses between
the all-caps words there...)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>This coming from the girl who has a fit every time her bink
isn't within eyesight and reach. Needless to say, we didn't quite
believe her, but we were willing to support her. We told her that
if she wants to stop using the bink, that's okay; it's also okay if
she decides to use it again. (Fully expecting she'd want it within
minutes of going to bed.)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Well... Maeve slept all night without it, and didn't want it
this morning, nor in the car. She's adamant, our little warrior
queen! (Which is what the Gaelic Maeve translates to in English, in
case you were wondering.)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I might be jumping the gun here, but I get the feeling our
little girl has taken another step in growing up... and I'm
bewildered and a little sad. Much as I've hated the bink the past
year, I also associate it with my little girl... and she's getting
so she's not so little any more!</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p><xhtml:b>UPDATE:</xhtml:b> I jumped the gun. She <xhtml:em>did</xhtml:em> go a full 24
hours, but the following night decided she wanted the bink again.
But there <xhtml:em>is</xhtml:em> hope for a bink-less future...</xhtml:p>
