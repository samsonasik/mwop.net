    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Inspired by a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/2016211">Slashdot book
        review</a> of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hpmysql/index.html">High
        Performance MySQL</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I've often suspected that I'm not a SQL guru... little things like being
    self taught and having virtually no resources for learning it. This has been
    confirmed to a large degree at work, where our DBA has taught me many tricks
    about databases: indexing, when to use DISTINCT, how and when to do JOINs,
    and the magic of TEMPORARY TABLEs. I now feel fairly competent, though far
    from being an expert -- I certainly don't know much about how to tune a
    server for MySQL, or tuning MySQL for performance.
</p>
<p>
    Last year around this time, we needed to replace our MySQL server, and I
    got handed the job of getting the data from the old one onto the new. At the
    time, I looked into replication, and from there discovered about binary
    copies of a data store. I started using this as a way to backup data,
    instead of periodic mysqldumps.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I've often wondered since: would replication be a good way to do
    backups? It seems like it would, but I haven't investigated.
    One post on the aforementioned Slashdot article addressed this, with the
    following summary:
</p>
<ol>
     <li>Set up replication</li>
     <li>Do a locked table backup on the slave</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Concise and to the point. I only wish I had a spare server on which to
    implement it!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/41-Cgiapp-Roadmap.html">Cgiapp Roadmap</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a few people contact me indicating interest in Cgiapp, and I've
    noticed a number of subscribers to the freshmeat project I've setup. In
    addition, we're using the library extensively at the <a href="http://www.garden.org">National Gardening Association</a> in
    developing our new site (the current site is using a mixture of ASP and
    Tango, with several newer applications using PHP). I've also been monitoring
    the CGI::Application mailing list. As a result of all this activity, I've
    decided I need to develop a roadmap for Cgiapp.
</p>
<p>Currently, planned changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Version 1.x series:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding a Smarty registration for stripslashes (the Smarty
            "function" call will be sslashes).</li>
            <li>param() bugfix: currently, calling param() with no arguments
            simply gives you a list of parameters registered with the method,
            but not their values; this will be fixed.</li>
            <li>error_mode() method. The CGI::Application ML brought up and
            implemented the idea of an error_mode() method to register
            an error_mode with the object (similar to run_modes()). While
            non-essential, it would offer a standard, built-in hook for error
            handling.</li>
            <li>$PATH_INFO traversing. Again, on the CGI::App ML, a request was
            brought up for built-in support for using $PATH_INFO to determine
            the run mode. Basically, you would pass a parameter indicating which
            location in the $PATH_INFO string holds the run mode.</li>
            <li>DocBook tutorials. I feel that too much information is given in
            the class-level documentation, and that usage tutorials need to be
            written. Since I'm documenting with PhpDoc and targetting PEAR,
            moving tutorials into DocBook is a logical step.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Version 2.x series:</b><br>
        Yes, a Cgiapp2 is in the future. There are a few changes that are either
        necessitating (a) PHP5, or (b) API changes. In keeping with PEAR
        guidelines, I'll rename the module Cgiapp2 so as not to break
        applications designed for Cgiapp.<br><br>
        Changes expected include:
        <ul>
            <li>Inherit from PEAR. This will allow for some built in error
            handling, among other things. I suspect that this will tie in with
            the error_mode(), and may also deprecate croak() and carp().</li>
            <li>Changes to tmpl_path() and load_tmpl(). In the perl version, you
            would instantiate a template using load_tmpl(), assign your
            variables to it, and then do your fetch() on it. So, this:
                <pre>
$this->tmpl_assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
                </pre>
            Becomes this:
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl();
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch('template.html');
                </pre>
            OR
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch();
                </pre>
            (Both examples assume use of Smarty.) I want to revert to
            this behaviour for several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Portability with perl. This is one area in which the PHP
                    and perl versions differ greatly; going to the perl way
                    makes porting classes between the two languages
                    simpler.</li>
                    <li>Decoupling. The current set of template methods create
                    an object as a parameter of the application object - which
                    is fine, unless the template object instantiator returns an
                    object of a different kind.</li>
                </ul>
            Cons:
                <ul>
                     <li>Smarty can use the same object to fill multiple
                     templates, and the current methods make use of this. By
                     assigning the template object locally to each method, this
                     could be lost.<br><br>
                     HOWEVER... an easy work-around would be for load_tmpl() to
                     create the object and store it an a parameter; subsequent
                     calls would return the same object reference. The
                     difficulty then would be if load_tmpl() assumed a template
                     name would be passed.  However, even in CGI::App, you
                     decide on a template engine and design for that engine;
                     there is never an assumption that template engines should
                     be swappable.</li>
                     <li>Existing Cgiapp1 applications would need to be
                     rewritten.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Plugin Architecture:</b>
                The CGI::App ML has produced a ::Plugin namespace that utilizes
                a common plugin architecture. The way it is done in perl is
                through some magic of namespaces and export routines... both of
                which are, notably, missing from PHP.<br><br>
                However, I think I may know a workaround for this, if I use
                PHP5: the magic __call() overloader method.<br><br>
                My idea is to have plugin classes register methods that should
                be accessible by a Cgiapp-based class a special key in the
                $_GLOBALS array.  Then, the __call() method would check the
                key for registered methods; if one is found matching a method
                requested, that method is called (using call_user_func()), with
                the Cgiapp-based object reference as the first reference. Voila!
                instant plugins!<br><br>
                Why do this? A library of 'standard' plugins could then be
                created, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A form validation plugin</li>
                    <li>Alternate template engines as plugins (instead of
                    overriding the tmpl_* methods)</li>
                    <li>An authorization plugin</li>
                </ul>
                Since the 'exported' methods would have access to the Cgiapp
                object, they could even register objects or parameters with it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    <div class="entry body"><p>The new weierophinney.net/matthew/ site is now up and running!</p>
<p>
    The site has been many months in planning, and about a month or so in actual
    coding. I have written the site in, instead of flatfiles, PHP, so as to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allow easier updating (it includes its own content management system</li>
    <li>Include a blog for my web development and IT interests</li>
    <li>Allow site searching (everything is an article or download)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I've written it using a strict MVC model, which means that I have libraries
    for accessing and manipulating the database; all displays are template
    driven (meaning I can create them with plain-old HTML); and I can create
    customizable applications out of various controller libraries. I've called
    this concoction <strong>Dragonfly</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    There will be more developments coming -- sitewide search comes to mind, as
    well as RSS feeds for the blog and downloads.
</p>
<p>Stay Tuned!</p></div>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    After working on some OO classes yesterday for an application backend I'm
    developing for work, I decided I needed to create a <tt>BREAD</tt> class to
    make this simpler. You know,
    <b>B</b>rowse-<b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>dit-<b>A</b>dd-<b>D</b>elete.
</p>
<p>
    At first, I figured I'd build off of what I'd done yesterday. But then I got
    to thinking (ah, thinking, my curse). I ran into the <tt>BREAD</tt> concept
    originally when investigating <tt>CGI::Application</tt>; a number of
    individuals had developed <tt>CGI::Apps</tt> that provided this
    functionality. I'd discarded them usually because they provided more
    functionality than I needed or because they introduced more complexity than
    I was willing to tackle right then.
</p>
<p>
    But once my thoughts had gone to <tt>BREAD</tt> and <tt>CGI::App</tt>, I
    started thinking how nice it would be to have <tt>CGI::Application</tt> for
    PHP. And then I thought, why not? What prevents me from porting it? I have
    the source...
</p>
<p>
    So, today I stayed home with Maeve, who, on the tail end of an illness,
    evidently ran herself down when at daycare yesterday, and stayed home
    sleeping most of the day. So, while she was resting, I sat down with a
    printout of the non-POD code of <tt>CGI::App</tt> and hammered out what I
    needed to do. Then, when she fell asleep for a nap, I typed it all out and
    started testing. And, I'm proud to say, it works. For an example, visit <a href="http://dev.weierophinney.net/cgiapp/test.php">my development
        site</a> to see a very simple, templated application in action.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/33-B.-Gates-Open-Source-Programmer.html">B. Gates: Open Source Programmer?</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I just read <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2004/03/19/programmers_at_work/">coverage 
        of a panel of programming luminaries on Salon;</a> the topic of
    discussion was about the state of programming. In the course of the
    discussion, the subject of Open Source came up. Several of the luminaries --
    which included architects of the Mac OS and Windows, as well as others --
    derided the community for basically reinventing the wheel, and wheels that
    need to be re-thought entirely anyways. One questioned, "Why is hte idealism
    just about how the code is shared -- what about idealism about the code
    itself?"
</p>
<p>
    Andy Hertzfeld (who helped develop the original Mac OS)  was sitting on the
    panel, and jumped in. He has been working with Eazel and Chandler in recent
    years, and thus has an inside view of open source. His initial comment:
    "It's because they want people to use the stuff!" Basically, they program
    Windows- or Mac-like interfaces because then people will be willing to try
    it out. They program office suites because people "need" an office suite to
    be productive. Such offerings hook them into the OSS movement.
</p>
<p>
    Another participant, Dan Bricklin (of VisiCalc, a pioneering spreadsheet
    program) shared an anecdote from Bill Gates. Evidently, Gates gave an
    interview (with Lammers -- look up this person) in which he explained that
    his work on MS's BASIC compiler was done by looking at how other programmers
    had accomplished the task. In his own words, "The best way to prepare is to
    write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written.
    In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I
    fished out listings of their operating systems." 
</p>
<p>
    So basically, Gates was an early adopter of OSS methodologies... Interesting
    to see that today he's so protective of MS code. Guess money might do that
    to you.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been researching and coding for a couple months now with the decision
    that I'd rewrite the family website/portal using mod_perl with
    CGI::Application. I still like the idea, but a couple things recently have
    made me rethink it.
</p>
<p>
    For starters, the perl DBI is a bit of a pain to program. At work, I've
    become very accustomed to using PEAR's DB library, and while it's in many
    ways derived from perl's DBI, it's much simpler to use. 
</p>
<p>
    Then there's the whole HTML::Template debacle. There's several ways in which
    to write the templates, but they don't all work in all situations, and, it
    seems they're a bit limited. We've started using PHP's Smarty at work, and
    it's much more intuitive, a wee bit more consistent, and almost infinitely
    more extendable. I could go the Template::Toolkit route for perl, but that's
    almost like learning another whole language.
</p>
<p>
    Then, there's the way objects work in perl versus PHP. I've discovered
    that PHP objects are very easy and very extendable. I wouldn't have found
    them half as easy, however, if I hadn't already been doing object oriented
    programming in perl. One major difference, however, is how easy it is to
    create new attributes on the fly, and the syntax is much easier and cleaner.
</p>
<p>
    Add to that the fact that if you want to dynamically require modules in
    perl, you have to go through some significant, often unsurmountable, hoops.
    So you can't easily have dynamic objects of dynamically defined classes. In
    PHP, though, you can require_once or include_once at any time without even
    thinking.
</p>
<p>
    The final straw, however, was when I did my first OO application in PHP this
    past week. I hammered it out in a matter of an hour or so. Then I rewrote it
    to incorporate Smarty in around an hour. And it all worked easily. Then I
    wrote a form-handling libary in just over two hours that worked immediately
    -- and made it possible for me to write a several screen application in a
    matter of an hour, complete with form, form validation, and database calls.
    Doing the same with CGI::Application took me hours, if not days.
</p>
<p>
    So, my idea is this: port CGI::Application to PHP. I <em>love</em> the
    concept of CGI::App -- it's exactly how I want to program, and I think it's
    solid. However, by porting it to PHP, I automatically have session and
    cookie support, and database support is only a few lines of code away when I
    use PEAR; I'll add Smarty as the template toolkit of choice, but make it
    easy to override the template methods to utilize . I get a nice MVC-style
    application template, but one that makes developing quickie applications
    truly a snap.
</p>
<p>
    This falls under the "right-tool-for-the-job" category; perl, while a
    wonderful language, and with a large tradition as a CGI language, was not
    developed <em>for the web</em> as PHP was. PHP just makes more sense in this
    instance. And I won't be abandoning perl by any stretch; I still use it
    daily at work and at home for solving any number of tasks from automated
    backups to checking server availability to keeping my ethernet connection
    alive. But I have real strengths as a PHP developer, and it would be a shame
    not to use those strengths with our home website.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    We're starting to use OO in our PHP at work. I discovered when I started
    using it why I'd been having problems wrapping my head around some of the
    applications I've been programming lately: I've become accustomed in Perl to
    using an OO framework. Suddenly, programming in PHP was much easier.
</p>
<p>
    There's a few things that are different, however. It appears that you cannot
    pass objects in object attributes, and then reference them like thus:
</p>
<pre>    $object->db>query($sql)
</pre>
<p>
    PHP doesn't like that kind of syntax (at least not in versions 4.x).
    Instead, you have to pass a reference to the object in the attribute, then
    set a temporary variable to that reference whenever you wish to use it:
</p>
<pre>    $object->db =& $db;
    ...
    $db = $object->db;
    $res = $db->query($sql);
</pre>
<p>
    What if you want to inherit from another class and extend one of the
    methods? In other words, you want to use the method from the parent class,
    but you want to do some additional items with it? Simple: use
    <kbd>parent</kbd>:
</p>
<pre>    function method1()
    {
        /* do some pre-processing */

        parent::method1(); // Do the parent's version of the method

        /* do some more stuff here */
    }
</pre>
<h4>Update:</h4>
<p>
    Actually, you *can* reference objects when they are attributes of another
    object; you just have to define the references in the correct order:
</p>
<pre>    $db =& DB::connect('dsn');
    $this->db =& $db;
    ...
    $res = $this->db->query($sql);
</pre>
<p>
    I've tested the above syntax with both PEAR's DB and with Smarty, and it
    works without issue.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    The CGI::Application::ValidateRM module utilizes HTML::FillInForm to fill in
    values in the form if portions did not pass validation. Basically, it
    utilizes HTML::Parser to go through and find the elements and match them to
    values. It's used because the assumption is that you've built your form into
    an HTML::Template, and that way you don't need to put in program logic into
    the form.
</p>
<p>
    Seems another good candidate for using FillInForm would be to populate a
    form with values grabbed from a database... I should look into that as well!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've used HTML::Template a little, mainly in the Secret Santa project I did
    this past Christmas for my wife's family. One thing I disliked was using the
    normal syntax: &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=IMAGE_SRC&gt; -- it made looking at it
    difficult (it wasn't always easy to tell what was an HTML tag, what was
    plain text, and what was HTML::Template stuff), and it made it impossible to
    validate my pages before they had data.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, there's an alternate syntax: wrap the syntax in HTML comments:
    &lt;!-- TMPL_VAR NAME=IMAGE_SRC --&gt; does the job. It uses more
    characters, true, but it gets highlighted different than HTML tags, as well,
    and that's worth a lot.
</p>
<p>
    And why do I have to say "NAME=" every time? That gets annoying. As it turns
    out, I can simply say: &lt;!-- TMPL_VAR IMAGE_SRC --&gt;, and that, too will
    get the job done.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, what about those times when I want to define a template, but have
    it broken into parts, too? Basically, I want HTML::Template to behave a
    little like SSI. No worries; there's a TMPL_INCLUDE tag that can do this:
    &lt;!-- TMPL_INCLUDE NAME="filename.tmpl" --&gt;.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been reading a lot of posts lately on the CGI::App mailing list about
    using CGI::Application::ValidateRM (RM == Run Mode); I finally went and
    checked it out.
</p>
    CGI::App::ValRM uses Data::FormValidator in order to do its magic.
    Interestingly, D::FV is built much like how I've buit our formHandlers
    library at work -- you specify a list of required fields, and a list of
    fields that need to be validated against criteria, then provide the
    criteria. It goes exactly how I would have done our libraries had we been
    working in perl -- supplying the constraint as a regexp or anonymous sub in
    a hashref for the field.

<p>
    Anyways, it looks like the combination of CGI::App::ValRM with CGI::App
    could greatly simplify any form validations I need to do on the site, which
    will in turn make me very happy!
