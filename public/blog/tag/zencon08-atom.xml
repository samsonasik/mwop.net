      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I'm a bit late on my <xhtml:a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon'08</xhtml:a> wrapup; the conference
left me both exhausted and with a backlog of email and work that
has consumed me since it ended. However, this, too, is good, as it
has given me time to reflect... and to finally get my slides up on
SlideShare.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>ZendCon was alternately exhausting, rewarding, educational,
fruitful, infurating, and ultimately wonderful. I've been to every
single ZendCon so far -- I started at Zend a scant month before the
inaugural event -- and have spoken at each. My first time speaking
was a fluke; <xhtml:a href="http://www.sklar.com/">David Sklar</xhtml:a> had
just started at <xhtml:a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</xhtml:a> and had to
back out of his "Configuring PHP" tutorial session. <xhtml:a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike Naberezny</xhtml:a> and I were drafted
to take it over, and we had N+1 attendees, where N was the number
of speakers. Since that inauspicious beginning, I've gradually
taken on more sessions and stuck around to participate in the
conference more. I can honestly say that this was the biggest,
busiest, and most community focussed ZendCon I can remember.</xhtml:p>
