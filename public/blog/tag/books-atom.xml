      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>Well, it's now official: <xhtml:a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/phpant2/">The PHP Anthology, 2nd
Edition</xhtml:a> is finally out, and, as you'll see if you follow the
link, I'm listed as an author on it. :-) It's a pleasant surprise
to see it out -- I finished my chapters back in January, and had
almost forgotten about it.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>For those curious, I penned Chapters 9 ('Error Handling'), 12
('XML and Web Services'), and 13 ('Best Practices'). If you're a
reader and have any feedback, I'd love to hear it.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Now, for those wondering about my bio: I submitted a few
sentences for a bio a few months ago, and somehow one of those got
abbreviated to 'Leading PEAR expert' on the main book landing page.
For those of you PEAR developers out there (Greg, Josh, Stig, and
many more I cannot list), <xhtml:b>you're</xhtml:b> the real PEAR experts, and
I thank you much for the many hours of coding you've saved me over
the years. I only hope my one little contribution (File_Fortune)
and many emails on the pear-dev list have helped any of you.</xhtml:p>
