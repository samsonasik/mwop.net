    <div class="entry body"><p>The new weierophinney.net/matthew/ site is now up and running!</p>
<p>
    The site has been many months in planning, and about a month or so in actual
    coding. I have written the site in, instead of flatfiles, PHP, so as to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allow easier updating (it includes its own content management system</li>
    <li>Include a blog for my web development and IT interests</li>
    <li>Allow site searching (everything is an article or download)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I've written it using a strict MVC model, which means that I have libraries
    for accessing and manipulating the database; all displays are template
    driven (meaning I can create them with plain-old HTML); and I can create
    customizable applications out of various controller libraries. I've called
    this concoction <strong>Dragonfly</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    There will be more developments coming -- sitewide search comes to mind, as
    well as RSS feeds for the blog and downloads.
</p>
<p>Stay Tuned!</p></div>

    Ever wonder what's keeping that device in use so you can't unmount it? It's
    happened to me a few times. The tool to discover this information?
    <kbd>lsof</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, you type something like: <kbd>lsof /mnt/cdrom</kbd> and it gives
    you a <kbd>ps</kbd>-style output detailing the PID and process of the
    processes that are using the cdrom. You can then go and manually stop those
    programs, or kill them yourself.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/2-PHP-and-Template-Engines.html">PHP and Template Engines</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    On <a href="http://www.phppatterns.com">PhpPatterns</a>, I recently read <a
        href="http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/article/articleview/4/1/1/">an
        article on Template Engines in PHP</a>. It got my ire up, as it said (my
    interpretation):
</p>
<ul>
     <li>"template engines are a bad idea"</li>
     <li>"templating using PHP natively can be a good idea"</li>
     <li>"template engines... are not worth the text
         their written in"</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Okay, so that's actually direct quotes from the article. I took issue with
    it, immediately -- I use <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> for
    everything I do, and the decision to do so was not done lightly. I have in
    fact been advocating the use of template engines in one language or another
    for several years with the various positions in which I've been employed; I
    think they are an essential tool for projects larger than a few pages. Why?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mixing of languages causes inefficiency. When I'm programming, it's
    incredibly inefficient to be writing in up to four different languages: PHP
    or Perl, X/HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Switching between them while in the
    same file is cumbersome and confusing, and trying to find HTML entities
    buried within quoting can be a nightmare, even when done in heredocs.
    Separating the languages into different files seems not only natural, but
    essential.</li>
    <li>Views contain their own logic. In an MVC pattern, the final web page
    View may be dependent on data passed to it via the Controller; however,
    this doesn't mean that I want the full functionality of a language like PHP
    or Perl to do that. I should only be doing simple logic or looping
    constructs -- and a full scripting language is overkill. (I do recognize,
    however, that template engines such as Smarty are written using PHP, so the
    language is being invoked regardless. What I speak of here is the language
    used to <em>compose the template</em>.)</li>
    <li>Abstraction and Security. The fewer internals that are divulged on the
    template page, the better. For security purposes, I may not want clients
    able to know <em>how</em> data got to the page, only what data is available
    to them. In addition, if this data is abstracted enough, any number of
    backends could be connected to the page to produce output.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    So, reading the aforementioned article really got my hackles up. However, it
    got me thinking, as well. One issue raised is that PHP can be used as your
    templating language. While I can understand why this might be desirable --
    everything from load issues to flexibility -- I also feel that this doesn't
    give enough abstraction. 
</p>
<p>
    Using PHP seems to me to be inefficient on two fundamental levels, based on
    my understanding of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Domain Langauge.</b> <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> suggests that
    <em>subsets</em> of a language should be used, or wholly new mini-languages
    developed, that speak to the domain at hand. As an example, you might want
    to use a sharp tool to open a can; an axe would be overkill, but a knife
    might work nicely. Using PHP to describe a template is like using an axe to
    open a can; it'll do the job, but it may also make a mess of it all, simply
    because it's too much sharp edge for the job.</li>
    <li><b>Metadata.</b> Metadata is data about data; to my thinking, templates
    describe the data they are communicating; the compiled template actually
    contains the data. In this regard, again, putting PHP into the script is
    overkill as doing so gives more than just some hints as to what the data
    is.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The author of the article also makes a case for teaching web designers PHP
    -- that the language is sufficiently easy to pick up that they typically
    will be able to learn it as easily, if not more easily, than a template
    language. I agree to a degree... But my experience has shown that web
    designers typically struggle with HTML, let alone PHP. (Note: my experience
    in this regard is not huge, and I'm sure that this is an exaggeration.) I
    find that it's typically easiest for me to give an example template, explain
    what the funny, non-HTML stuff can do, and let them go from there. Using
    this approach, they do not need to learn anything new -- they simply work
    with placeholders.
</p>
<p>
    Still, I think the author raises some fine points. I wish he'd bothered to
    do more research into <em>why</em> people choose template engines and the
    benefits that arise from using them <em>before</em> simply outright slamming
    them. Of course, the article is also a bit dated; it was written over two
    years ago, and much has changed in the world of PHP and many of its template
    engines. I'm curious as to whether they would feel the same way today.
</p>
<p>
    Me? My mind is made up -- the benefits, in my circumstances, far outweigh
    any costs associated. I'll be using template engines, and <a
        href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> in particular, for years to
    come.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I'd read that you could get binary packages for gentoo, thus alleviating the
    need to compile everything. (Of course, then  you lose some of the benefits
    of compiling everything, but you gain in speed...) Unfortunately, I mistook
    this with ebuilds, and never quite figured it out.
</p>
<p>
    The key is to throw the -g flag:
</p>
<pre>    % emerge -g gnumeric # which is like 'emerge --getbinpkg gnumeric'
</pre>
<p>
    I also learned how to update packages tonight:
</p>
<pre>    % emerge sync             # to sync your mirror with the gentoo mirrors
    % emerge --update portage # if necessary
    % emerge --update system  # updates core system files
    % emerge --update world   # updates all packages

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/31-Gentoo-for-several-weeks.html">Gentoo for several weeks</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a bunch of problems with my new computer -- it uses ACPI, but if I
    load the ACPI modules, it won't boot; if I don't load them, I have to go
    through contortions to get the ethernet working, and it won't power down;
    and a bunch of other little stuff.
</p>
<p>
    So, a few weeks ago, I thought, what the heck? Why not try <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>? I've been reading about it
    since it first came out, and I remember talking with Duane about it once,
    and it has a reputation for both being cutting edge and stable. Heck, even
    Wil Wheaton's endorsing it... it can't be <b>all</b> bad, right?
</p>
<p>
    I had a few misstarts -- bad CDs, not quite getting how the chroot thing
    worked, problems with DNS (which I <em>still</em> don't understand; and Rob
    has them as well, so it's not just me). But once I got it installed... well,
    I'm impressed.
</p>
<p>
    The thing about Gentoo is, it <em>compiles</em> everything from source. It's
    like <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, in that it fetches all
    dependencies and installs those... but it's all source. So it's not exactly
    fast. But because everything is compiled, and because you setup C flags
    specific to your machine, what you get is incredibly optimized for your own
    machine. This 1.6GHz machine simply flies. And the memory usage <em>just
        stays low</em>.
</p>
<p>
    I'd like to use it for my server... but I can't really take the server down
    at this point when it's making both my mom and myself money. But what a
    great system... I only wish I'd used it for the mail server at work.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    After working on some OO classes yesterday for an application backend I'm
    developing for work, I decided I needed to create a <tt>BREAD</tt> class to
    make this simpler. You know,
    <b>B</b>rowse-<b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>dit-<b>A</b>dd-<b>D</b>elete.
</p>
<p>
    At first, I figured I'd build off of what I'd done yesterday. But then I got
    to thinking (ah, thinking, my curse). I ran into the <tt>BREAD</tt> concept
    originally when investigating <tt>CGI::Application</tt>; a number of
    individuals had developed <tt>CGI::Apps</tt> that provided this
    functionality. I'd discarded them usually because they provided more
    functionality than I needed or because they introduced more complexity than
    I was willing to tackle right then.
</p>
<p>
    But once my thoughts had gone to <tt>BREAD</tt> and <tt>CGI::App</tt>, I
    started thinking how nice it would be to have <tt>CGI::Application</tt> for
    PHP. And then I thought, why not? What prevents me from porting it? I have
    the source...
</p>
<p>
    So, today I stayed home with Maeve, who, on the tail end of an illness,
    evidently ran herself down when at daycare yesterday, and stayed home
    sleeping most of the day. So, while she was resting, I sat down with a
    printout of the non-POD code of <tt>CGI::App</tt> and hammered out what I
    needed to do. Then, when she fell asleep for a nap, I typed it all out and
    started testing. And, I'm proud to say, it works. For an example, visit <a href="http://dev.weierophinney.net/cgiapp/test.php">my development
        site</a> to see a very simple, templated application in action.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/33-B.-Gates-Open-Source-Programmer.html">B. Gates: Open Source Programmer?</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I just read <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2004/03/19/programmers_at_work/">coverage 
        of a panel of programming luminaries on Salon;</a> the topic of
    discussion was about the state of programming. In the course of the
    discussion, the subject of Open Source came up. Several of the luminaries --
    which included architects of the Mac OS and Windows, as well as others --
    derided the community for basically reinventing the wheel, and wheels that
    need to be re-thought entirely anyways. One questioned, "Why is hte idealism
    just about how the code is shared -- what about idealism about the code
    itself?"
</p>
<p>
    Andy Hertzfeld (who helped develop the original Mac OS)  was sitting on the
    panel, and jumped in. He has been working with Eazel and Chandler in recent
    years, and thus has an inside view of open source. His initial comment:
    "It's because they want people to use the stuff!" Basically, they program
    Windows- or Mac-like interfaces because then people will be willing to try
    it out. They program office suites because people "need" an office suite to
    be productive. Such offerings hook them into the OSS movement.
</p>
<p>
    Another participant, Dan Bricklin (of VisiCalc, a pioneering spreadsheet
    program) shared an anecdote from Bill Gates. Evidently, Gates gave an
    interview (with Lammers -- look up this person) in which he explained that
    his work on MS's BASIC compiler was done by looking at how other programmers
    had accomplished the task. In his own words, "The best way to prepare is to
    write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written.
    In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I
    fished out listings of their operating systems." 
</p>
<p>
    So basically, Gates was an early adopter of OSS methodologies... Interesting
    to see that today he's so protective of MS code. Guess money might do that
    to you.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I was lamenting at work the other day that now that I've discovered OO and
    templating with PHP, the only major feature missing for me is a way to
    easily document my programs. I'm a big fan of perl's POD, and use it fairly
    extensively, even for simple scripts -- it's a way to provide a quick manual
    without needing to worry too much about how to format it.
</p>
<p>
    So, it hit me on the way home Friday night: what prevents me from using POD
    in multiline comments of PHP scripts? I thought I'd give it a try when I got
    home.
</p>
<p>
    First I googled for 'POD for PHP', and found a link to perlmongers where
    somebody recounted seeing that exact thing done, and how nicely it worked.
</p>
<p>
    Then I tried it.. and it indeed worked. So, basically, I've got all the
    tools I love from perl in PHP, one of which is borrowed directly from the
    language!

    I've been researching and coding for a couple months now with the decision
    that I'd rewrite the family website/portal using mod_perl with
    CGI::Application. I still like the idea, but a couple things recently have
    made me rethink it.
</p>
<p>
    For starters, the perl DBI is a bit of a pain to program. At work, I've
    become very accustomed to using PEAR's DB library, and while it's in many
    ways derived from perl's DBI, it's much simpler to use. 
</p>
<p>
    Then there's the whole HTML::Template debacle. There's several ways in which
    to write the templates, but they don't all work in all situations, and, it
    seems they're a bit limited. We've started using PHP's Smarty at work, and
    it's much more intuitive, a wee bit more consistent, and almost infinitely
    more extendable. I could go the Template::Toolkit route for perl, but that's
    almost like learning another whole language.
</p>
<p>
    Then, there's the way objects work in perl versus PHP. I've discovered
    that PHP objects are very easy and very extendable. I wouldn't have found
    them half as easy, however, if I hadn't already been doing object oriented
    programming in perl. One major difference, however, is how easy it is to
    create new attributes on the fly, and the syntax is much easier and cleaner.
</p>
<p>
    Add to that the fact that if you want to dynamically require modules in
    perl, you have to go through some significant, often unsurmountable, hoops.
    So you can't easily have dynamic objects of dynamically defined classes. In
    PHP, though, you can require_once or include_once at any time without even
    thinking.
</p>
<p>
    The final straw, however, was when I did my first OO application in PHP this
    past week. I hammered it out in a matter of an hour or so. Then I rewrote it
    to incorporate Smarty in around an hour. And it all worked easily. Then I
    wrote a form-handling libary in just over two hours that worked immediately
    -- and made it possible for me to write a several screen application in a
    matter of an hour, complete with form, form validation, and database calls.
    Doing the same with CGI::Application took me hours, if not days.
</p>
<p>
    So, my idea is this: port CGI::Application to PHP. I <em>love</em> the
    concept of CGI::App -- it's exactly how I want to program, and I think it's
    solid. However, by porting it to PHP, I automatically have session and
    cookie support, and database support is only a few lines of code away when I
    use PEAR; I'll add Smarty as the template toolkit of choice, but make it
    easy to override the template methods to utilize . I get a nice MVC-style
    application template, but one that makes developing quickie applications
    truly a snap.
</p>
<p>
    This falls under the "right-tool-for-the-job" category; perl, while a
    wonderful language, and with a large tradition as a CGI language, was not
    developed <em>for the web</em> as PHP was. PHP just makes more sense in this
    instance. And I won't be abandoning perl by any stretch; I still use it
    daily at work and at home for solving any number of tasks from automated
    backups to checking server availability to keeping my ethernet connection
    alive. But I have real strengths as a PHP developer, and it would be a shame
    not to use those strengths with our home website.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    We're starting to use OO in our PHP at work. I discovered when I started
    using it why I'd been having problems wrapping my head around some of the
    applications I've been programming lately: I've become accustomed in Perl to
    using an OO framework. Suddenly, programming in PHP was much easier.
</p>
<p>
    There's a few things that are different, however. It appears that you cannot
    pass objects in object attributes, and then reference them like thus:
</p>
<pre>    $object->db>query($sql)
</pre>
<p>
    PHP doesn't like that kind of syntax (at least not in versions 4.x).
    Instead, you have to pass a reference to the object in the attribute, then
    set a temporary variable to that reference whenever you wish to use it:
</p>
<pre>    $object->db =& $db;
    ...
    $db = $object->db;
    $res = $db->query($sql);
</pre>
<p>
    What if you want to inherit from another class and extend one of the
    methods? In other words, you want to use the method from the parent class,
    but you want to do some additional items with it? Simple: use
    <kbd>parent</kbd>:
</p>
<pre>    function method1()
    {
        /* do some pre-processing */

        parent::method1(); // Do the parent's version of the method

        /* do some more stuff here */
    }
</pre>
<h4>Update:</h4>
<p>
    Actually, you *can* reference objects when they are attributes of another
    object; you just have to define the references in the correct order:
</p>
<pre>    $db =& DB::connect('dsn');
    $this->db =& $db;
    ...
    $res = $this->db->query($sql);
</pre>
<p>
    I've tested the above syntax with both PEAR's DB and with Smarty, and it
    works without issue.
